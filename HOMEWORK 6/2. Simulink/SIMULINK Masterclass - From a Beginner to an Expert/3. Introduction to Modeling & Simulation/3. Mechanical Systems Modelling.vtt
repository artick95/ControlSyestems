00:00.900 --> 00:02.270
Before going to simulate.

00:02.330 --> 00:08.540
It's very important to understand the concept of mathematical modelling of some systems and engineering.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.840
We have a giving system which can be mechanical electrical hydraulic and simple.

00:13.980 --> 00:18.860
In some cases a system can have for example mechanical and electric components.

00:18.860 --> 00:24.630
We apply as a related physical concept to rides a mathematical equations that governs a system.

00:24.630 --> 00:30.010
These equations can be used for further modelling techniques like process modelling actually simulate

00:30.020 --> 00:35.930
because a tool to create a process modeling for a giving system in this lecture you are going to look

00:35.930 --> 00:39.090
at the mess medical modelling of some mechanical systems.

00:39.170 --> 00:45.540
You will learn how to write them as medical equations and then how to find this transfer function in

00:45.540 --> 00:48.420
mechanical systems are some important components.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.330
Zohar spring damper and mass.

00:51.450 --> 00:54.660
Spring is a mechanical element that resists motion.

00:54.660 --> 01:02.430
The spring has a constant K and two ends each and has a certain displacement the resistant force developed

01:02.430 --> 01:07.640
by a spring according to hawks low F S equals to k times delta.

01:07.680 --> 01:15.030
The spring exerts force if only users are different in displacement between its two ends at Ember.

01:15.170 --> 01:19.690
Same as the springs the number has of them being coefficient C and two ends.

01:19.690 --> 01:27.070
The number force F D equals to C times delta velocity which means that the number only exerts force

01:27.120 --> 01:33.030
if there is a change in velocity and their sheer force before talking about in their sheer force.

01:33.030 --> 01:37.830
I need to say that there is a big debate in considering an issue of force a real force.

01:37.830 --> 01:44.400
I don't believe that inertia forces are real forces and this helps me a lot to modern mechanical systems

01:44.400 --> 01:45.330
very easily.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.500
However it's not our subject.

01:47.670 --> 01:54.150
MSM has emotion for example why instead of direction and in their sheer force is developed and equals

01:54.150 --> 01:59.540
to mass times acceleration or NY that will dots in the other direction.

01:59.580 --> 02:03.940
These are linear components which means they are related to linear emotion.

02:03.960 --> 02:09.030
There are also rotating elements like torsion a spring or rotating damper and inertia.

02:09.050 --> 02:14.030
There are resisting rotating motion and mathematical modelling of mechanical systems.

02:14.040 --> 02:18.070
We write the equation of motion for each mass or inertia element.

02:18.120 --> 02:26.260
We do that by drawing the free body that Graham and analyzing the forces using Newton's second law.

02:26.330 --> 02:28.600
Let's see an example in this example.

02:28.610 --> 02:31.940
A mass m has a motion y in the right direction.

02:31.970 --> 02:38.690
The mass is connected to a member which is mounted on the wall and to a spring the spring 2nd end is

02:38.690 --> 02:44.590
moving was displacement X which is input by throwing a free but at the Graham of mass m.

02:44.620 --> 02:51.650
There are three forces inertia of force which equals two m y double dots spring force which is K times.

02:51.650 --> 02:58.640
Delta and Delta here is Y minus X then being forced which is equals to see y dot.

02:58.640 --> 03:06.250
Now summing all the forces including this in your sheer force and equal all forces to zero I want to

03:06.250 --> 03:12.010
say that according to Newton's Second low the summation of all the forces in a moving body equals to

03:12.010 --> 03:13.740
mass times acceleration.

03:13.750 --> 03:20.280
But I'm using that embedded concept which is considering any moving system is a balanced system or the

03:20.290 --> 03:25.260
term of their sheer force is a force that balances the system.

03:25.270 --> 03:31.390
So the sum mission of all forces including the inertia of force equals to zero in order to make sure

03:31.390 --> 03:33.190
that the equation of motion is correct.

03:33.190 --> 03:38.950
Always make sure that the mass motion terms why why adults and why they will not have the same sign

03:39.670 --> 03:46.150
now running down the equation of motion and why double thoughts plus Seaway plus K times why minus X

03:46.180 --> 03:52.930
equals to zero or m y there's a lot plus you thought plus K Y equals two K X in order to complete the

03:52.930 --> 03:57.430
mass medical modelling and move to process modelling using plug that grandma will take is an A plus

03:57.430 --> 04:05.170
transformation of this equation so m y the DOT is M S A SQUARE Y Capital C I thought is C S Y capital

04:05.440 --> 04:13.510
K why is K Y capital K X is K X capital as you can see is a differential equation is now and then Djibril

04:13.540 --> 04:20.800
equation and it's easy to write down just transfer function which is output overs and but by thinking

04:20.800 --> 04:28.150
y capital as a common factor y times MSA squared plus C S plus k equals two K X Y over x equals two

04:28.150 --> 04:31.090
K over MSA squared plus C S plus K

04:37.420 --> 04:42.610
let's see another example this example is nothing but the previous problem but instead of linear motion

04:42.610 --> 04:49.900
is a rotating motion we have here in there she had J and a rotating member C torsion is spring K which

04:49.900 --> 04:57.150
is a flexible shaft that post ends are rotating in a different angles see the eye and said oh just creates

04:57.150 --> 05:06.300
an existing torque end but as I said I the rotation of inertia is cedar Oh now write downs a torque

05:06.300 --> 05:09.030
equation based on the free but a diagram.

05:09.120 --> 05:18.200
Same as the force the equation of motion J C the O double lot plus C C the O dot plus K time C to o

05:18.200 --> 05:27.050
minus C I equals 2 0 j you see it oh double dot plus C C the O dot plus k c the O equals to K CDI by

05:27.050 --> 05:34.310
taking the plus transformation of this equation and ordering the terms C the O overseas I equals 2 k

05:34.310 --> 05:43.270
over J as a squared plus C S plus k.

05:43.430 --> 05:49.820
Now let's move to process modelling techniques using plot diagram which is very similar to simulating

05:49.970 --> 05:56.000
in some cases it's easier to express them as medical equations in a block for the main function of this

05:56.000 --> 06:03.560
block is to show exactly is a process that is needed to go from input to output to block that Grams

06:03.650 --> 06:10.340
consists of arrows or signals rectangular blocks and summing blocks let's see an example.

06:10.430 --> 06:18.770
This is a block diagrams that relates the input x does output y output Y equals two B times A times

06:18.890 --> 06:25.160
X minus Y times C A B and C are some sorts of operations.

06:25.430 --> 06:27.570
Let's examine this equations.

06:27.890 --> 06:32.430
Y equals to a signal B which is multiplied by another signal a.

06:32.480 --> 06:40.790
So these strict angled blocks represents a and b a line that goes from A to B means is that A is multiplied

06:40.790 --> 06:49.220
by B B A is multiplied by another signal called X minus Y C which means take an arrow or signal from

06:49.490 --> 06:56.870
output y multiplied by a block called C and the result is subtracted from the input x using a summation

06:56.870 --> 07:04.700
pluck the final the result is X minus Y C so lets follows this plot that gram an input x is entering

07:04.700 --> 07:12.830
that a gram X signal is subtracted from Y C to produce x minus y c x minus y c is multiplied by a and

07:12.830 --> 07:20.720
Z multiplied by B the result is Y equals to be a times x minus y see the Y signal is defeated back to

07:20.720 --> 07:30.260
complete and closes a block diagram Y is and multiplied by C let's apply this on our two examples.

07:30.280 --> 07:36.360
Now you can think of how easy becomes after taking a plus transformation of the equation of motion it's

07:36.380 --> 07:42.610
a block diagram of post examples is a simplest form of any plug diagram and the first example is the

07:42.700 --> 07:48.110
input x signal is multiplied by this transfer function to produce output y.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.150
The second example is the same the input signal is see the eye.

07:52.210 --> 07:58.870
That is multiplied by as the transfer function K over J as a squared plus C S plus K to produce the

07:58.900 --> 08:00.160
output CDO.
