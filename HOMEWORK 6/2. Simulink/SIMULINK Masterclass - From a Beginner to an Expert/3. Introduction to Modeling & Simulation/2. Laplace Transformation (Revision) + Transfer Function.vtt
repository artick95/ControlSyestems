00:00.640 --> 00:06.100
Before we start mathematical and process modelling of systems we need to revise one of the most useful

00:06.130 --> 00:13.210
concepts in mathematics Laplace transform the strength of Laplace transform comes from its ability to

00:13.210 --> 00:18.960
transform differential equations into algebraic equations in all our mass medical modelling.

00:18.970 --> 00:25.420
We will deal with differential equations transforming differential equations into algebraic equations

00:25.510 --> 00:32.200
will make it easier to find what we call the transfer function and also will introduce a process modelling

00:32.200 --> 00:41.390
using plug diagrams plus transform can be defined as follow Laplace of F of T which is the function

00:41.420 --> 00:48.280
of T in time domain equals two and you function of S or the frequency domain.

00:48.400 --> 00:58.050
The blast of F of T equals to the integration from 0 to infinity of E to the minus SD times f of t d

00:59.780 --> 01:04.450
in this course we are interested in some functions which can be found in the following table

01:09.510 --> 01:15.690
moving to the transfer function and modelling and simulation transfer function or system function is

01:15.690 --> 01:21.250
a mathematical function relating the ambush or response of a forgiving system to the input for this

01:21.260 --> 01:22.430
system.

01:22.470 --> 01:28.860
For example the transfer functions that relates inputs X which is a displacement on a spring was the

01:28.860 --> 01:35.220
stiffness K to the output Y which you described the motion of a certain nice

01:38.420 --> 01:43.820
and the following lectures you will learn how to model some systems to fund the transfer functions and

01:43.820 --> 01:46.220
also throwing the plug diagrams.
