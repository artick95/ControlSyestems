00:00.300 --> 00:07.230
Welcome back guys in this video I want to talk about control systems and any control system we have

00:07.230 --> 00:09.400
what we call planet or a process.

00:09.930 --> 00:15.300
And actually this contains a different mass mannequin emboldening or different mismanagement equations

00:15.480 --> 00:18.030
and govern the planet.

00:18.060 --> 00:21.930
We have an input and produces an output.

00:22.290 --> 00:28.110
If you want an example imagine that we are right things a mathematical equations of a suspension system

00:28.650 --> 00:37.290
we have an input of the disturbance of the road and the output is a response of the chassis or the response

00:37.380 --> 00:44.270
of the wheel and actually in any control system we want to control the output.

00:44.540 --> 00:52.760
We want to add a certain input to produce a desired output like for example a DC motor you want to add

00:52.760 --> 00:57.260
a certain voltage in order to have a certain speed on the shaft.

00:57.380 --> 01:02.020
The first thing to do that is you want to measure is the object of your system.

01:02.030 --> 01:09.440
So in any control system we have what we call a feedback and actually feedback may contains some different

01:09.440 --> 01:11.060
types of sensors.

01:11.160 --> 01:17.480
Two measures of Woods a planet or the system produces it calls feedback because this signal which is

01:17.510 --> 01:27.760
output is a feedback again to what we call a controller a controller is a brain of the control system.

01:28.030 --> 01:35.590
So it's a process of controlling any system consists of having a blunted supply can be for example a

01:35.590 --> 01:36.630
DC motor.

01:36.730 --> 01:40.200
So we have our metro circuit of this DC motor.

01:40.420 --> 01:45.580
We have the field circuit and we have for example to work and so on.

01:45.610 --> 01:51.340
So we are applying crucial flows on the circuit and we are applying that mechanical or Newton's low

01:51.440 --> 01:59.260
on this to work to produce will because most medical modelling of this planet smiling and modelling

01:59.410 --> 02:08.110
we defines inputs and outputs of the system and we add some sensors lags a potential meter in order

02:08.110 --> 02:16.900
to measure the speed or the output of this DC motor and we feedback this signal to what we call the

02:16.900 --> 02:23.710
controller a controller is a brain or the smart part of the system like API.

02:23.710 --> 02:31.440
The controller actually the controller tells what is the required input in order to produce a specific

02:31.470 --> 02:37.450
output based on some equations or some calculations which are done in this controller.

02:38.880 --> 02:47.800
So feedback is a signal and we are sensing error here or between the desired output and outputs upon

02:47.800 --> 02:48.370
it.

02:48.450 --> 02:55.920
Produce on the situation and calculations are done here in the controller in order to provide a certain

02:55.950 --> 03:00.480
output which is input to this planet to produce the desired output.

03:00.480 --> 03:04.050
So in any control system you need to define or to do three steps.

03:04.050 --> 03:07.080
Step number one is to lose a mathematical modelling of your system.

03:07.080 --> 03:12.540
Step number two is to select the feedback measurements so authors that you can select the different

03:12.540 --> 03:15.870
sensors two measures of different object.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.930
Step number three is to design your controller.

03:18.930 --> 03:26.910
You may for example want to use API the controller and the controller or the plane of the system relates

03:26.940 --> 03:32.680
and you input or the input to the system to the desired output.

03:33.070 --> 03:35.710
What are the types of any control systems.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.550
Actually we have two types of control system.

03:38.590 --> 03:41.150
Number one continuous system.

03:41.170 --> 03:48.910
If your system input or different parameters are changing was timed so we call this continuous system.

03:48.910 --> 03:55.930
An example is a DC motor you have a voltage which is changes over time and the output is the speed of

03:56.020 --> 03:58.860
the motor which is also changing over time.

03:58.870 --> 04:04.870
For example the suspension of a car you have a certain input which is a disturbance or a bump of the

04:04.870 --> 04:05.560
road.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.190
It can be for example sine wave.

04:08.380 --> 04:14.860
It's changing with time and the output is a response of the Chelsea or the response of the suspension

04:14.860 --> 04:21.850
system which is also changing with time so inputs and different variables which we call state variable

04:21.970 --> 04:23.510
change over time.

04:24.610 --> 04:33.280
So next time is discrete in this time the inputs and different variables of the system change between

04:33.580 --> 04:35.200
some defined points.

04:35.200 --> 04:40.880
So in this system you feed an input and you have a sudden change of your output if you want an example

04:40.880 --> 04:50.800
we can imagine you often for example you are feeding a signal of 1 or 0 to cook something and paste

04:50.800 --> 04:51.830
on this input.

04:51.890 --> 05:00.640
That often states changes immediately and at once to another state which is cooking your food for example

05:00.740 --> 05:07.630
to the input here is discrete one to turn on the oven and the output is also discrete which is cooking

05:07.630 --> 05:15.460
state can also switch off your oven by adding a discrete input like zero and the output is changing

05:15.460 --> 05:23.140
the over state from cooking to turned off a good topic on discrete systems is designing is a finite

05:23.140 --> 05:28.420
state machine and actually in this course you will find a complete section talking about how to use

05:28.420 --> 05:35.290
semi link in order to define finite state machines are funded state machines are used in many applications

05:35.290 --> 05:44.650
around you like oven microwaves washing machines maybe for example air conditioning traffic lights and

05:44.740 --> 05:52.210
many applications in automotive so this course will teach you how to use finance state machine as an

05:52.210 --> 05:59.140
application of discrete systems in order to design sometimes of discrete systems.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.340
That's all for this section.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.280
Thank you guys for watching and seems the next section.
