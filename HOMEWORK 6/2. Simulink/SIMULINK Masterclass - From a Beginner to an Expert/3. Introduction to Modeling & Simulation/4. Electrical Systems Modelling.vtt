00:00.970 --> 00:06.550
Now let's take a look at the most medical modelling of electric systems we are considering.

00:06.550 --> 00:09.060
Only these are LC circuits.

00:09.060 --> 00:13.900
Remember that's the objective of this section is to present how to develop the best medical modelling

00:13.900 --> 00:20.170
of some important systems and patents that we do as a process smuggling or not providing deep information

00:20.170 --> 00:22.230
about the physics of these systems.

00:23.840 --> 00:29.810
Same as the mechanical systems there are some important components in any electric systems.

00:29.820 --> 00:37.630
They are number one resistor a resistor is an electric components that resists the current flow and

00:37.650 --> 00:43.220
resistance V of T equals to r which is a resistor constant times.

00:43.250 --> 00:43.910
Are you t

00:47.010 --> 00:47.970
a capacitor.

00:47.990 --> 00:54.090
It's also known as condenser the capacitor is used to store energy in an electric field.

00:54.130 --> 00:59.140
So if you're building an electric systems and you want to store energy for some time and after that

00:59.140 --> 00:59.800
you use it.

00:59.800 --> 01:11.530
We use capacitor and capacitor V of T equals to 1 over C times integration of IE D.T. and inductor and

01:11.530 --> 01:18.490
inductor or coil resists change in electric current passing through it when I can't throw an inductor

01:18.530 --> 01:26.590
energies toward temporary but this time in form of magnetic field V of T equals two L times D I buy

01:26.590 --> 01:37.230
the t to solve our LC problems we use cash flows we have two lows Casey L or cash of current flow and

01:37.230 --> 01:46.320
K L or cash flow voltage low Casey l Casey l state Z the sum of electrical current entering and exiting

01:46.350 --> 01:56.080
and nude in a circuit must be equal and Kaveh l state Z the sum of voltage differences around any closed

01:56.170 --> 02:05.880
loop in a circuit is 0 there are two types of RLC circuits series and peril.

02:05.900 --> 02:14.390
This is an example of a serious circuit assembled here is voltage E I and the output is e all current

02:14.450 --> 02:22.250
ie flows and a circuit which consists of three components coil resistor and capacitor by applying Kaveh

02:22.260 --> 02:32.600
L on the first loop and the I buy the t plus R times I plus one of C integration i.e. t equals to e

02:32.600 --> 02:42.390
I the second loop one of our C times integration I t equals to E L taking the plus transformation less

02:42.410 --> 02:52.880
times I off as plus R times IV s plus one of our c s times I've s equals to E all of us the second equation

02:53.120 --> 02:58.030
one over C as times I F as equals 2 e all farce.

02:58.070 --> 03:06.200
So the transfer function e all over E R equals to one over it'll C S A squared plus our C S plus one

03:12.060 --> 03:19.980
another circuit the circuit has three loops by applying K vehicle on the first loop are one I one plus

03:20.010 --> 03:26.970
one over C one times integration of the current flows and the capacitor which is the difference between

03:26.970 --> 03:38.820
i1 and i2 so 1 over a c 1 times integration of i1 minus I2 t equals 2 e I second loop are two times

03:38.890 --> 03:48.060
I two plus one over C1 integration this time I two minus i1 T plus one over C two integration I two

03:48.090 --> 03:50.000
DTA equals two zero.

03:50.010 --> 03:58.770
Third loop e all equals to one over C two times integration of I2 D.T. taking the plus transformation

03:58.860 --> 04:10.740
one over C one s times I want S minus I2 s plus R 1 I want as equals 2 e I second equation one over

04:10.740 --> 04:21.330
C 1 s times I 2 minus i1 plus R two times I two plus one of our C two times as times I 2 equals two

04:21.330 --> 04:27.290
zero sir the equation one over two as times I two as equals to equal.

04:27.390 --> 04:30.740
If you want to draw as a plug diagram of the following model.

04:30.780 --> 04:40.020
Think about it if the input is E I and output is e 0 so if we go from e i to i 1 from the first equation

04:40.110 --> 04:48.410
and from I want to I 2 from the second equation we can go finally from I 2 2 8 0 which is output in

04:48.420 --> 05:01.950
the third equation because e 0 equals 2 I 2 times 1 over C 2 s so you fi plus I 2 times 1 over C 1 s

05:02.340 --> 05:10.320
and the result is multiplied by 1 over C 1 times s plus R to produce i1 I want is multiplied by one

05:10.320 --> 05:19.830
over C one s over are two plus one over C 1 s plus one over a C two s to get s eye to eye to is and

05:19.820 --> 05:25.770
feed it back and I two is also multiplied by one of our C two s to get equal

05:28.560 --> 05:31.710
in some cases the components can p in peril.

05:31.710 --> 05:38.870
In this case it's easier to model the system and as domain rather than te domain s domain modelling

05:38.870 --> 05:46.700
we replace each component with what we call impedance in time domains resistance is R button as domain

05:46.700 --> 05:55.910
we replace R with impedance Z DHA which is actually equals to r the coil L in t domain and an S domains

05:55.910 --> 06:05.240
it l equals two L times s capacitor C and as domain is one over C S and then we ride the system different

06:05.240 --> 06:15.640
equation directly in as domain let's see an example in this example is the input is v i and output is

06:15.750 --> 06:22.560
V.S. and we have two loops R and L are connected in parallel so I will not have this problem in estimate

06:22.560 --> 06:29.430
estimating the circuit and as the looks like this just replace each component with its impedance.

06:29.650 --> 06:36.850
Now we can replace as it R and Z L was equivalent impedance they are connected in parallel so Z are

06:36.850 --> 06:48.520
L equals to Z R times Z L overs R plus it l now applying KP L V IV as equals to IV s times Z C plus

06:48.520 --> 07:02.650
it r l the C of as equals to IV as times Z R L so v c over V R equals 2 z R L over Z C plus Z RL And

07:02.650 --> 07:11.110
who knows at Z R equals to R Z L equals two L s and finally Z C equals 2 1 over C S.
