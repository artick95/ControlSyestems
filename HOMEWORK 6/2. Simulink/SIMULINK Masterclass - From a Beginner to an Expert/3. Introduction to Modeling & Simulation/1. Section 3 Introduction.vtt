00:00.210 --> 00:05.890
Elementary students and Malcolm to section number three which is introduction to modelling and simulation.

00:05.910 --> 00:12.720
The Section was intended to be section number two but some students may have good background on most

00:12.720 --> 00:14.770
medical modelling for some systems.

00:14.790 --> 00:20.490
I want to move directly to Samuel link so getting it started with some your link was moved to be section

00:20.490 --> 00:21.260
number two.

00:21.360 --> 00:26.040
If you're familiar with mathematical modelling you're welcome to skip the section and move to the fancied

00:26.040 --> 00:31.560
section if you want to refresh your memory or if you don't have any background and mathematical modelling

00:31.770 --> 00:38.480
for some systems then you can watch as a section before SECTION NUMBER TWO GETTING STARTED TO semi link

00:38.960 --> 00:45.330
and also you have an option to watch as a section of after finishing getting a start assembling what

00:45.330 --> 00:49.860
is the section structure actually in the section we are going to deal with.

00:49.950 --> 00:57.570
Three main topics in the first lecture we're going to talk about plus transformation plus I will introduce

00:57.570 --> 01:02.610
the concept of transfer function in the next lecture as we are going to do them as medical modelling

01:02.610 --> 01:10.010
of some systems like mechanical electrical hydraulic you'll also get introduced to a process modelling

01:10.010 --> 01:12.890
techniques using plug diagrams.

01:13.130 --> 01:14.640
So let's get a started.
