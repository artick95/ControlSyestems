Hello Missouri students and welcome to the first section in the simulated course.

00:12.900 --> 00:18.660
In this section I'm going to introduce to you the concepts of modelling and simulation.

00:18.690 --> 00:27.360
So let's get started modelling and simulations are ways to understand the world around us through creativity

00:27.360 --> 00:36.420
and imagination grocery types of modelling physical mathematical and process physical model physical

00:36.420 --> 00:40.500
model the one who looks or feels like the real thing.

00:40.560 --> 00:48.870
This could be a toy statue or the drawings for a house mathematical model.

00:48.950 --> 00:55.600
This medical model is the one that uses mathematical symbols and relations to describe some think for

00:55.600 --> 01:02.630
example the equation used to describe the motion of the car's suspension a certain type of models the

01:02.630 --> 01:07.620
process model described the steps we need to follow to get something done.

01:07.730 --> 01:16.050
It could be as simple as a To Do list or a computer flowchart was these three types of models we can

01:16.050 --> 01:25.710
model anything systems equipments people even behaviors just like there are three types of models there

01:25.710 --> 01:34.550
are three types of simulations live virtual and constructive a life simulation is the one that involves

01:34.640 --> 01:42.860
real people operating real systems just like practicing for pull or soldiers simulating military maneuvers

01:44.580 --> 01:53.040
virtual simulation who are real people operates simulated systems like flight simulators or drive simulators

01:54.390 --> 02:02.070
constructive simulations constructive simulation who are simulated people operate simulated programs

02:02.370 --> 02:10.310
people provides inputs in this situation and the simulation tell us what might happen this section will

02:10.310 --> 02:16.730
be related to modeling we will learn the fundamentals of modelling some types of systems like mechanical

02:17.000 --> 02:24.350
electrical and hydraulic we will look at polls most medical models and process models using plug diagrams

02:24.440 --> 02:26.840
some physical concepts will be explained.
