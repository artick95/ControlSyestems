00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
Welcome to MATLAB/SIMULINK Mastery Course. This is the course Introduction.

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:11.632
There is nothing better than getting introduced to this course via an application from real life

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.666
Think about how a simple dish washer works

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.800
First you set the washing time which controls the time to clean the dishes

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.800
The dish washer will run based on that time. The output is the dishes

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.700
and regardless of the cleanliness of the dishes, the dish washer will stop after that set time.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.233
The dish washer here is our system

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.799
There are some physics behind how the different components work

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:39.099
And in order to design this dish washer you need to understand the physics

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.666
and express it in Mathematical Equations

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.100
There are also other techniques to represent how the dish washer works

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Not only that but also simulating the output of the dish washer

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.033
based on a certain input without even building the dish washer.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:01:01.666
If you have loaded the dish washer with 10 dishes full of cake the set time might not be enough to clean them

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.533
So imagine that we have added a sensor to measure how the dishes are cleaned

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.433
and we compared this measurement to a desired level of cleanliness

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.066
the difference between them is fed to what we call a controller

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:23.699
which is designed to analyse and provide correction action to the time set in order to reach the desired level of cleanliness.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.999
We call this closed loop control system.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:31.799
To design any control system you have to follow 3 different steps

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.399
1- Model the system which in our case the dish washer

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.966
This could be done by writing the mathematical equations to describe how it works

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:46.199
Further modelling could be done using SIMULINK to visualize the different system components.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:51.666
2 – You have to understand clearly what is the purpose of this control system

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:59.866
in our example we want our controller to update the time we’ve set in order to reach the required level of cleanliness.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:03.033
Finally design and simulate the controller.

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:11.066
These 3 steps require certain skills to master, and these skills are covered in details inside this course.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:16.166
In addition you need understand how the software of the dish washer works

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:20.166
for example how this dish washer respond to different user inputs

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:25.032
like turning on or off, setting time, chose programme and so on

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:30.333
and this is done by what we finite state machine which is also part of this course.

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:36.999
Based on that we can summarize the course structure to 4 different sections.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:42.632
Section 1: Getting started with MATLAB/SIMULINK which is a friendly step by step introduction

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.099
to master the basics of SIMULINK.

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:51.632
Section 2: Introduction to modelling & Simulation, in which you will learn how to do both the mathematical modelling

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:59.266
and process modelling using block diagrams for different types of systems like (Mechanical – Electrical & Hydraulic)

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.666
Section 3: which is an advanced section in which you learn how to use MATLAB SIMULINK

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:11.999
to model and simulate real life applications and also how to build and tune different controllers

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:17.832
Section 4: you will learn how to design and simulate Finite State Machines

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:27.166
In this course you will solve some problems from real life like: Modelling & simulation of a car suspension system

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:29.799
Modelling & Simulation of a DC Motor

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:37.166
We will also look at problem of tank level controlling, we will design a PID controller to solve this problem

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:44.932
We will design and simulate the system of traffic light and also we will design and simulate the car turning signal system.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:50.433
We update this course from time to time which means new projects will be added. And you will be informed.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.200
We ask you to have some knowledge prior to join this course they are

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:02.499
1 – Having a MATLAB/SIMULINK software you can download the new vrisions from mathwork website

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:08.999
2 – You should be familiar with MATLAB , the syntax, how to programme in MATLAB using M-files

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.333

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:15.466
3 – It will be very good if you have a mathematical background.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:21.399
In order to get the maximum benefit out of this course follow my 3 steps

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:28.699
Step 1 Watch every lecture first address the problem discussed , pause if you want to think about this problem

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.733
And after finishing the lecture try to re model and solve the problem yourself. So Watch and Apply.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.333
Step 2 Finish all the quizzes, assignments and don’t skip them.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:46.766
Step 3 Ask for help rembeber We are here to help you

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:50.532
