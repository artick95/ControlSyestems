00:00.210 --> 00:01.920
Welcome back guys.

00:01.920 --> 00:07.950
So in this lecture I will show you this assignment answer and we are going to simulate the DC a servo

00:07.950 --> 00:14.040
motor in Samuel link but this time an estimate by using transfer functions.

00:14.160 --> 00:18.230
So first is assignment answer from the previous lecture we have.

00:18.230 --> 00:22.940
These equations in XYZ domain you have vehicles to I.

00:22.950 --> 00:33.950
Times are plus SL plus Becky MF Becky MF equals to k b times that seat a lot and talk equals to Katy.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.320
Times I also talk equals to seats at all times.

00:38.340 --> 00:38.770
J.

00:38.780 --> 00:40.900
S plus B.

00:40.950 --> 00:48.840
So our input here is a voltage by looking at the first equation we will feed the voltage the two something

00:48.900 --> 00:56.430
point the voltage signal B and plus and there is another signal in minus which is a Becky M F signal

00:58.260 --> 01:08.600
voltage minus spec IMF equals two ie times are plus says l so I will multiply by one over R Plus SL

01:08.960 --> 01:11.140
to produce I.

01:11.780 --> 01:20.330
Now by looking at the third equation we have eye times Katie equals to talk from this equation and from

01:20.330 --> 01:29.330
last equation if I multiplied the torque times 1 over J S plus P I will produce seat that now I can

01:29.330 --> 01:35.560
take the signal off a seat of thought and multiplied by KP In the second equation to produce is about

01:35.600 --> 01:44.150
IMF and Becky MF can be seated to this summing point in order to produce I as you can see in the first

01:44.150 --> 01:45.140
equation.

01:45.140 --> 01:51.890
So this is a block diagram or modelling is a system in the s domain is very simple and very easy.

01:51.980 --> 01:59.750
I want you to write down this model because we will use these blocks in our assembling model moving

01:59.750 --> 02:00.900
to the semi link.

02:00.910 --> 02:05.960
Now I have created this new model from the commonly used blocks.

02:06.200 --> 02:11.390
I will add gain constant and scoop.

02:11.430 --> 02:17.910
I will also add something point and from continuous I will add transfer function

02:24.960 --> 02:28.740
I will use the same and file from the previous video.

02:28.830 --> 02:36.620
This is my file which contains the different values or different system parameters or L key TKD the

02:36.730 --> 02:38.230
J.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.260
Back to the system.

02:40.350 --> 02:49.190
So first of all I have this input which is constant 5 it's feed it to someone point

02:52.530 --> 02:55.950
list of signs of the summing point are plus and minus

02:58.900 --> 03:04.690
and I have to transfer functions so this is the first block of the first transfer function and that

03:04.690 --> 03:09.540
will feed the signal here and I have two gains.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.650
This is the first one

03:14.470 --> 03:16.480
and we have zero as a transfer function

03:21.750 --> 03:31.430
and from here we have a scoop because this is the output see thought and I can flip this this is the

03:31.440 --> 03:37.730
K.B. so I will take another signal from here from see the vote multiplied by KP To reduce it by IMF

03:38.150 --> 03:40.580
and feed it back to the summing point.

03:40.820 --> 03:51.960
The first transfer function is 1 over plus SL So double take the coefficients are are or sorry.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.510
L plus or L here would be less and R will be R now.

03:59.670 --> 04:08.800
Okay now I have one over less plus or the second transfer function is one over G S plus B.

04:08.800 --> 04:16.710
So this is J and this is B the first gain is Katie.

04:16.730 --> 04:24.550
So this is Katie and this is K B.

04:24.640 --> 04:31.540
Now I have a model that you see motor in as domain by using transfer functions which is very efficient

04:31.570 --> 04:33.290
and very fast.

04:33.310 --> 04:34.550
Now lets runs a small

04:39.350 --> 04:48.460
I got an error here because I forgot to run my end file so I will pack and roms and file now run change

04:48.460 --> 04:54.360
folder and I will pack and run the symbol link model again.

04:54.470 --> 04:57.170
Now it takes time and simulation so we will wait

05:15.610 --> 05:16.090
finished.

05:16.090 --> 05:19.930
Now I can double click the scoop to check the speed of the shaft.

05:28.710 --> 05:31.910
As you can see this is the velocity of the motor.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.770
Don't get confused because of this graph.

05:34.770 --> 05:43.980
Actually it's a constant value of nine point 6 1 5 1 which is the same result as the time domain modelling

05:43.980 --> 05:45.320
system.

05:45.410 --> 05:51.150
Double click on the scope here I will find that we have also commerce and value of line by line 6 1

05:51.150 --> 05:52.920
5 1.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.540
That's all for this review.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.300
Thank you guys for watching.

05:56.360 --> 06:01.230
The next review we will look at its API controller and similar link so see user.
