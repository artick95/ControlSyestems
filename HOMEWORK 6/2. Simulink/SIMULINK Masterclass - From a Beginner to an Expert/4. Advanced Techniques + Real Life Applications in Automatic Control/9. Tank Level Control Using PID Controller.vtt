00:00.120 --> 00:00.990
Welcome back guys.

00:01.800 --> 00:07.130
So in this lecture I will show you how to use P I.D. controller in semi link.

00:07.250 --> 00:13.350
We will apply this on the tank level control system we have built in the previous lectures.

00:13.520 --> 00:19.710
As I have discussed in a previous lecture we have this tank level control problem we have here a tank.

00:19.710 --> 00:24.610
We are providing floor rate to this tank inside this pipe seat.

00:24.760 --> 00:25.590
So we have here.

00:25.590 --> 00:34.830
Q2 enters this tank and Q1 leaves us as think and we have used this system in order to provide the control

00:34.860 --> 00:41.610
actions to our tank so that when measuring the height of the thing by using this as float and providing

00:41.640 --> 00:48.640
a reference input are to this error the ticketing device we are providing here that control action throws

00:48.640 --> 00:56.490
his gears in order to control the open of this valve to prevent a Q2 which is provided to this thing

00:56.490 --> 00:58.620
in order to control the height level.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.170
And we have built this model.

01:01.170 --> 01:09.120
This is the subsystem which contains the model of the tank and we have built this proportional controller.

01:09.120 --> 01:09.990
We are changing.

01:10.020 --> 01:15.840
Changing the value of key E and K in order to provide the control action to the stink.

01:16.650 --> 01:19.780
And we have simulated this thing.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.610
Let's reduce this time to frozen Bolton and runs a model

01:28.570 --> 01:30.090
as you can see here is the difference.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.150
Input is or point three.

01:32.170 --> 01:39.070
We have some oscillations or overshoot but we haven't reached the Steady State Value which is 0 point

01:39.070 --> 01:39.910
3.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.020
There is a city state there.

01:42.400 --> 01:48.200
If you want to know the value of the steady state early you can add for example from sinks you can add

01:48.220 --> 01:52.920
display block and take away from here.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.040
Now runs a model again.

01:59.060 --> 02:05.510
As you can see we have value of 0 point 2 9 6 6 which is not all point 3.

02:05.510 --> 02:10.750
So yes it's a very small city state error but actually we have a city state there.

02:10.790 --> 02:16.730
So in this video I will replace a proportional controller was almost a AP idea controller and I will

02:16.730 --> 02:22.930
show you how to tune this idea the controller in order to remove the steady state data.

02:23.030 --> 02:33.580
So first I will delete the subsystem or this controller I'll move it from here from plucks I will search

02:33.580 --> 02:34.900
for P. I.D.

02:37.660 --> 02:42.260
Now I will find different blocks for P idea controller.

02:42.340 --> 02:50.040
In this example I will use P idea controller pluck so double click and add to tank prop controller.

02:52.460 --> 02:54.830
Now I will wear this P idea controller.

02:56.710 --> 03:03.910
In order to for my control problem or as a control system if I double click on the P.A. the controller

03:04.900 --> 03:13.780
as you can see the controller type is p I.D. proportional integral and derivative I can change to p

03:14.030 --> 03:14.840
IPD.

03:14.860 --> 03:15.790
P I.

03:15.790 --> 03:22.540
And so on in the form of this piece the controller is parallel which means that the different three

03:22.540 --> 03:24.980
controllers parallel to each other.

03:26.050 --> 03:33.010
We have years of different values of gains of proportional integral and derivative controllers the default

03:33.010 --> 03:36.140
values are 1 1 0.

03:36.460 --> 03:44.250
So I will run this model using this default value in order to see the system before adding them to an

03:44.260 --> 03:47.850
API controller and after 2 employ the controller.

03:47.890 --> 03:53.260
So K and the will run the model by reference value here.

03:53.260 --> 03:58.460
Here is 0 point 3 which is the desired output of the system.

03:58.540 --> 04:04.180
Now if I double click this this is Coupe I will find that the tank level is increasing until I reach

04:04.180 --> 04:12.280
it to this small value which is not all points 3 and it keeps increasing with time in order to to you

04:12.280 --> 04:20.440
an API the controller to provide a certain output which is a desired output in our case we are using

04:20.440 --> 04:27.860
some to do that so I will double click this P.I. the controller and I will hit tune

04:36.040 --> 04:40.690
now on other graph of the response the tank side is now shown.

04:42.870 --> 04:46.910
And I can drag these two options in order to tune my response.

04:46.910 --> 04:55.070
For example if I want this system or the level to reach the steady state or 2 or point 3 in our example

04:55.160 --> 05:03.380
very fast I would drag this to the right as you can see here as the response is updated and I am decreasing

05:03.960 --> 05:11.180
the response time to a point in line 5 7 which means that this system will reach 2 0 point three and

05:11.180 --> 05:12.380
a very small time.

05:12.500 --> 05:20.900
If I want to increase this time just as some reach 2 or points 3 in longer time.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.030
So for example I will add it here.

05:25.110 --> 05:31.950
Here I can control the transient behavior if I want my system to be more aggressive which means it will

05:31.950 --> 05:37.010
reach or the settling time of the system will be slow.

05:37.260 --> 05:41.200
But this may adds overshoots to our system.

05:41.460 --> 05:48.360
If you're not familiar with any parameter in the speed the controller or the tuning of the controller

05:48.360 --> 05:53.830
you can right click at any point and click.

05:53.830 --> 05:54.700
What is this.

05:56.110 --> 06:00.730
So here as you can see I have opened a new window talking about trauma and Pavia

06:04.350 --> 06:07.210
now I will use these to add value and click ok

06:12.130 --> 06:19.270
now as you can see I have tuned my PDA controllers a proportional term is zero derivative term is zero

06:19.270 --> 06:25.360
and actually I'm using only integral controller was a constant equals to six hundred ninety five point

06:25.360 --> 06:25.900
one two.

06:25.960 --> 06:34.030
OK and let's run this model in this case as you can see here I have reached two points 3 which means

06:34.030 --> 06:44.150
that I have removed the steady state error which is expected from integral controller I won't lead this

06:45.540 --> 06:49.490
double click the scoop as you can see here.

06:49.530 --> 06:56.100
The system takes very small time to reach to the steady state point which is or point three.

06:56.130 --> 07:05.450
I have a small overshoot which can be decreased by increasing the settling time so we have designed

07:05.450 --> 07:09.810
and tuned the idea controller in order to control the level of the stick.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.370
That's all for this video.

07:11.370 --> 07:14.370
Thank you guys for watching and see you in the next video.
