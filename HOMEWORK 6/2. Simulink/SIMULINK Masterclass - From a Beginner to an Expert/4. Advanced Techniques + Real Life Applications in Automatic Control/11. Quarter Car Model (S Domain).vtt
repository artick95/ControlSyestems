00:00.420 --> 00:01.640
Welcome back guys.

00:01.650 --> 00:06.000
In this video we are going to continue our problem which is of course our car model.

00:06.210 --> 00:07.790
But this time an to me.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.870
So let's get it started.

00:09.870 --> 00:15.950
These are the equation of motion of the course record model from the previous review by balancing M.S.

00:15.960 --> 00:23.060
we have the equation M.S. why see that a lot plus C1 y c dot plus key one Y C by balancing m s.

00:23.070 --> 00:29.760
We have the equation M S Y as double dog plus C1 y s dot plus key one or key two plus key one times

00:29.760 --> 00:37.890
Y S equals two C1 why is he dots plus key one Y C plus K two times the input x so we need to take plus

00:37.890 --> 00:43.980
transformation of both equation so I want you to pose a video and a star typing equation of motions

00:43.980 --> 00:47.000
in s domain and compare them with my equations.

00:48.620 --> 00:49.930
Welcome back guys.

00:49.970 --> 01:01.550
So the equation of motions in his domain are Y C over Y S equals to C1 s plus k 1 over MCO squared plus

01:01.550 --> 01:11.540
C S plus k 1 the second equation y as equals 2 y c times C one s plus key 1 over M S A squared plus

01:11.540 --> 01:21.620
C1 s plus key one plus key two plus X times K two times m s s s squared plus C1 s plus q on plus K too.

01:21.650 --> 01:27.080
So in order to model this system I will add three times for function the first transfer function is

01:27.080 --> 01:34.880
this function and by multiplying this transfer function times a signal y s we will have Y C or the response

01:34.880 --> 01:41.030
of the Chelsea we can take the response of the Chelsea and multiply it again by this transfer function

01:41.240 --> 01:43.910
add them to say input x time.

01:44.030 --> 01:51.110
This transfer function and this will produce Y S which will be fitted to produce Y C and so on.

01:51.110 --> 01:58.640
So let's see this on the semi link I have created a new model so let's as a different blocks from block

01:58.640 --> 02:10.460
library from continuous air transfer function right click et on titled From commonly use blocks I will

02:10.460 --> 02:14.750
add some and I will add scoop

02:17.460 --> 02:19.980
and from sources I will add step function

02:25.220 --> 02:28.880
we have three transfer functions so I will copy this transfer function three times

02:33.300 --> 02:40.200
and I will show the response of the Chelsea and the suspension system so I will copy scoop block twice

02:45.670 --> 02:52.370
remembers that I have this file which contains the values of the different parameter M.C. MSE 1 C1 key

02:52.370 --> 02:55.670
to first of all I will.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.860
Whereas this transfer function to the school block.

02:59.300 --> 03:08.180
So this is why I see this as a transfer function c 1 s plus key 1 over M.C. s squared plus C1 s plus

03:08.180 --> 03:15.850
k 1 so double click the numerator is C1

03:18.480 --> 03:19.320
and k 1

03:23.170 --> 03:24.430
the denominator is

03:27.070 --> 03:37.910
M.S. c 1 Q1 OK.

03:38.150 --> 03:44.540
So now we have added the transfer function C1 s plus k 1 over MSE a squared plus C1 plus s 1

03:49.870 --> 04:00.160
this signal is Y C so I will feed the signal pack and multiply it to another transfer function but first

04:00.160 --> 04:04.710
I need to flip this plug flip

04:08.090 --> 04:12.740
when you look at the second equation you will see is that why C is multiplied by this transfer function

04:16.110 --> 04:20.760
C1 K1 denominator

04:23.490 --> 04:26.170
M S C1

04:29.050 --> 04:31.570
key one plus key two inside brackets

04:34.590 --> 04:35.010
OK

04:40.490 --> 04:42.690
on move this here and this one here

04:47.680 --> 04:55.450
I'll move to some Michigan block here the step and book which is x is multiply it to the transfer function

04:57.290 --> 04:57.950
which is

05:01.190 --> 05:08.380
key to numerator over the denominator M.S.

05:10.890 --> 05:11.480
C1

05:15.550 --> 05:18.550
key one plus key to

05:26.290 --> 05:29.510
will arrange my model and expenses

05:38.010 --> 05:39.930
moves this here.

05:39.930 --> 05:42.780
Whereas the signal here I will leave this one

05:45.960 --> 05:55.100
and wire as a signal here so as input x is multiplied by this transfer function Y C is multiplied by

05:55.150 --> 06:04.710
this transfer function and Zi are added together here to produce y s y is now is multiplied by as this

06:04.710 --> 06:15.510
block to produce Y C and I have added a scoop to plot the signal of Y C and from this a scoop I can

06:15.600 --> 06:19.870
take a signal from here to plot y yes.

06:20.490 --> 06:27.000
Now my model is ready on I have a set of different values of these variables so I can run my model the

06:27.000 --> 06:37.120
time here is 10 seconds so run let's see the response of the suspension movement this is the response

06:37.240 --> 06:46.860
as you can see I have some oscillations until damped and this is a response of the Chelsea again it's

06:46.950 --> 07:01.120
up to one point four I forgot to set the step number two certainly millimeters so wrong again.

07:01.230 --> 07:06.420
So now it's up to almost forty five and then the movement is damped

07:10.900 --> 07:19.190
again degrees the value of the number make it six for example and from back to our model and Ron

07:25.030 --> 07:31.120
now is oscillation as you can see are increased because we have reduced the dumping coefficient

07:33.770 --> 07:41.920
and this is the response of the HSC can actually compares the results from using elsewhere function

07:42.430 --> 07:48.460
to the results from modelling in time domain as I have mentioned in the video of the modelling the spring

07:48.460 --> 07:50.020
number system.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.840
Thank you guys for watching and see you in the next tweet you.
