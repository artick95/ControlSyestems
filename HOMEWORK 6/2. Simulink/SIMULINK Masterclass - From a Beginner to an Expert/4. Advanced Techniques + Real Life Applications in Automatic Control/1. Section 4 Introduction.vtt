00:00.210 --> 00:01.680
Welcome to the section number for

00:04.730 --> 00:05.310
this section.

00:05.310 --> 00:10.040
You're going to learn some advanced techniques in MATLAB Samuel Inc.

00:10.070 --> 00:16.650
And this is done through real life applications in mechanical headed like in electrical systems.

00:18.080 --> 00:24.110
And this section you will see how to use simulated canola to model and simulate think level control

00:24.820 --> 00:32.490
will use proportional controller in order to control the level of this liquid inside this tank and also

00:32.510 --> 00:37.480
show you how to use the controller in order to provide more accurate control action.

00:41.110 --> 00:43.630
You will also as messes bring them our system.

00:43.630 --> 00:53.350
We will model the system in both time domain and s domain by using specific function.

00:53.460 --> 00:58.300
And also we will look at molding and simulation of DC several motor.

00:58.590 --> 01:03.390
I'll show you how to type the most money and equations of the system and use a similar link in order

01:03.390 --> 01:06.760
to simulate that you see several motor.

01:06.850 --> 01:11.990
I'll also explain the servo mechanism and the from problems of the system.

01:16.690 --> 01:18.880
Also even look at a quarter car model.

01:18.880 --> 01:26.200
I will show you how to model the suspension system of a vehicle in time domain and frequency domain

01:26.260 --> 01:27.290
or as domain.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.680
And also will show you how to modify the system.

01:29.770 --> 01:32.070
If you have a very damning coefficient.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.750
So let's get it started.
