WEBVTT

00:00.240 --> 00:06.420
So in a previous view we have done the most medical modelling of tank level control and also I have

00:06.420 --> 00:09.180
used similar link in order to simulate the smaller.

00:10.110 --> 00:18.410
And as you can see we have here increased amount of tank height by increasing the time.

00:18.420 --> 00:25.800
So what if you want to control the tank height or to maintain that thing quite a certain point for example

00:26.220 --> 00:28.100
or point three millimeter.

00:28.110 --> 00:34.970
In this case we need to add something new to our most medical modelling or to our system.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.170
This is what we call a controller.

00:37.340 --> 00:42.320
If you have watched the previous section we have talk about the control systems.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.420
I have explained that we have here a planet with mathematical equations or most medical modelling of

00:47.420 --> 00:55.180
this planet and we take a feedback of the orbit of this planet and we feed it to what we call a controller.

00:55.180 --> 01:01.430
And so the controller there are some calculations in order to have or to maintain a certain output of

01:01.430 --> 01:02.610
the planet.

01:02.630 --> 01:06.740
So this is what we are going to do in the tank level a control problem

01:10.940 --> 01:19.200
as you can see some new systems are introduced to our problem and the main problem we have here a flow

01:19.200 --> 01:26.130
rate paste on the position of the throttle which is Q2 Q2 is feed inside this thing.

01:26.280 --> 01:34.380
Height is increase with time and we have here Q1 which leaves us think and this is sort of law I have

01:34.380 --> 01:41.820
added here error detecting device and they're detecting device we have a reference value of r which

01:41.820 --> 01:51.390
is a position and we have here a float which reflects the change of the tank height the difference between

01:51.660 --> 02:01.680
this reference input and the height is fitted to this air detecting which has constant k e to produces

02:01.740 --> 02:11.160
voltage e this voltage e is amplified by this amplifier was a constant K A to produce V which is fitted

02:11.160 --> 02:18.120
to this server mortar and the servo motor output speed is C the adult which is connected to the input

02:18.130 --> 02:25.890
throttle by this gear system so now and is teed off openings as volt by hand we have this motorized

02:25.890 --> 02:35.100
system based on a measurement from the output which is height inside this electric circuit to produce

02:35.100 --> 02:41.980
a motion on this motor in order to decide which seat heavy or seat the V lot of this valve system.

02:42.420 --> 02:49.630
So let's see is a mathematical equations or most medical modelling of this new system these three equations

02:49.630 --> 02:56.050
from the previous most medical modelling of the tank without the controller we have q two equals two

02:56.080 --> 03:04.150
K V times see the V adult Q two minus Q one equals two a each dot which is a continuity equation and

03:04.150 --> 03:08.760
from this throttle we have q one times R equals two each.

03:08.830 --> 03:16.990
Now inside this error detecting device we have reference input R which is again any position like for

03:16.990 --> 03:24.670
example 0 points three meter or point or three meter and so on minus etch which is measured using this

03:24.670 --> 03:35.200
float times the constant of error detecting device which is key to produce voltage e now by using amplifier

03:35.760 --> 03:48.550
was constant K A V equals two K A times e we have this equation which relates to output of the motor

03:48.580 --> 03:55.810
or the speed of the motor C to M by the voltage inside this motor see the m the block equals to one

03:55.810 --> 04:00.900
hundred thirty three times voltage minus or point six seven C to Emerald.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.810
So as this relation is based on this server motor so we have nothing to do with this equation this equation

04:07.810 --> 04:08.890
is given.

04:08.890 --> 04:17.070
And finally we have the solar speed CTV that equals to the motor speed see the m not over is a good

04:17.080 --> 04:17.950
rescue.

04:18.130 --> 04:24.280
Now let's try to model this new system and Samuel link and see how to use this proportional controller

04:24.280 --> 04:30.700
in order to control and maintain the height of this tank at a certain level and see if we will manage

04:30.700 --> 04:34.920
to maintain the height of the required value or not.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.410
This is our model from the previous video.

04:38.150 --> 04:48.800
And actually I will delete this input and the SCOOP and I will select all this model right click and

04:48.800 --> 04:53.970
I will create subsystem from selection.

04:54.130 --> 05:00.880
Now I have this subsystem which is the system of the thing or the mathematical equations of the thing

05:00.910 --> 05:02.410
without any controller.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.240
So I would call it thank

05:07.360 --> 05:16.230
actually I can change the image of this block by right click and add mosque and here I will use its

05:16.230 --> 05:22.180
function image of I will need an image.

05:22.350 --> 05:28.030
So another function I am great.

05:28.530 --> 05:31.280
Just make sure that the image is in the same folder.

05:31.290 --> 05:37.130
You have saved this modelling so I have an image tank.

05:37.270 --> 05:49.180
The J P G now apply and OK as you can see I've changed this image or the image of the subsystem to this

05:49.180 --> 05:52.630
new image can select any image you want.

05:52.630 --> 05:59.340
So I will add another subsystem so you can search for subsystem

06:03.160 --> 06:07.440
this one here right click and add to Untitled I will drag it here.

06:07.510 --> 06:10.500
Call it controller

06:16.250 --> 06:18.500
commonly used blocks I will add some point

06:21.380 --> 06:23.150
and I forgot to add scope

06:26.640 --> 06:34.380
so if he remembers are from tank subsystem is the height etch so is plotted on the scope

06:42.060 --> 06:50.020
and I will take a feedback from etch and I will feed it to the summing point minus

06:53.080 --> 06:59.750
and I have here as a reference input ah which is for example constant.

06:59.770 --> 07:03.070
So from sources only the constant

07:05.570 --> 07:07.250
off or point three

07:10.360 --> 07:13.230
which is fitted to this summing clock.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.270
So.

07:15.330 --> 07:24.700
Or or point three minus etch is fitted to the controller and the arbiter the controller is the input

07:24.730 --> 07:27.190
to the tank.

07:29.940 --> 07:36.990
Now I need to double click the controller and start to build my control system so the input here is

07:36.990 --> 07:38.120
R minus edge.

07:39.510 --> 07:49.240
So first single I add some gains from commonly use blocks 0 net gain.

07:49.660 --> 07:56.090
I will add integrator and then add something point OK

07:59.300 --> 08:00.320
I will lead this

08:03.240 --> 08:14.530
I can call it input to Ann Arbor to not to get confused with the tank input and output now the input

08:14.530 --> 08:17.830
here which is or minus edges multiplied by gain.

08:18.010 --> 08:18.640
Katie.

08:19.360 --> 08:27.280
So again I have the same file but I have updated you have here constant k equals to 0.01 the tank or

08:27.280 --> 08:29.980
the throttle the resistance equals to 0 point to 5.

08:29.990 --> 08:33.420
Think every area equals two or point eight.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.600
We have this constant here from the air detecting device.

08:36.610 --> 08:46.870
K equals to 200 hundred voltage over a meter so if we have distance equals to one meter we will produce

08:46.900 --> 08:48.610
two hundred volt.

08:49.420 --> 08:58.370
We have here is a constant of amplifier which is 50 and we have here is a gear issue and equals to 100.

08:58.390 --> 09:08.170
Now we're on this model and I have these different variables in the workspace back to the subsystem

09:09.600 --> 09:12.280
on Kobe's this game.

09:12.360 --> 09:19.790
This is K E m from the equations you can see that are minus edge.

09:19.880 --> 09:29.730
Times k equals to small in order to reduce the voltage or the output of the amplifier we multiply e

09:29.730 --> 09:38.020
times the amplifier constant which Okay so we can take our minus edge and multiplied by k e times K

09:38.040 --> 09:40.990
in order to produce the.

09:41.060 --> 09:43.040
So this is key.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.620
E minus K now okay.

09:46.700 --> 09:56.240
Whereas this here and expand this we have relation between the moderate speed and acceleration and the

09:56.240 --> 09:58.790
input voltage to this motor.

09:58.790 --> 10:05.720
See them they will look equals to one hundred thirty three times V minus 0 point six seven times C to

10:05.900 --> 10:11.170
m not so I will feed this facing v signal

10:14.060 --> 10:16.550
to another gain which is one hundred insert three

10:19.680 --> 10:22.490
and out output is feed it to a summing point

10:27.400 --> 10:30.560
the object of this summing point is see the MWD.

10:31.210 --> 10:38.570
So now I have multiplied the times one hundred and thirty three.

10:38.760 --> 10:47.780
This is in plus minus this signal here will be 0 point six seven times Seta M lot.

10:47.830 --> 10:50.470
Now I don't have any seat m.

10:50.800 --> 10:56.800
This will produce seat M double dot so I can take take the signal which is see them the look and integrate

10:56.800 --> 10:57.520
it to have seat.

10:57.520 --> 10:58.070
I m not.

10:58.840 --> 11:03.520
And take a signal from C time dot to feed back and close the loop.

11:04.630 --> 11:13.880
So if I integrate the system or the signal seats I m level look the integration is C to m dot and c

11:13.880 --> 11:20.600
to him dot almost R signal times is this game.

11:20.620 --> 11:22.040
But first I need to flip it

11:25.530 --> 11:30.520
does gain is 0 point 6 7

11:34.470 --> 11:36.040
I'll feed it to this same point

11:38.560 --> 11:41.600
trysts leads us in feed.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.250
This one here.

11:42.250 --> 11:47.020
Double Click to change the sine.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.530
This is minus here.

11:49.980 --> 12:02.470
This is produce C to handle it now is C time the Times one over n two this is one over n produces CTV

12:02.480 --> 12:13.710
don't so the input to this controller is reference R and the output is C to veto it.

12:13.790 --> 12:26.050
Now back to untitled we have here is a tank and controller we have a reference R then to this controller

12:26.050 --> 12:34.900
is R minus etch so this r and this feedback here etch R minus etch inside this controller in order to

12:34.900 --> 12:43.440
produce see the v dot and see the result is feed it inside this thing in order to produce etch.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.310
Now I can run this model

12:48.030 --> 12:49.360
double click on the scoop

12:52.400 --> 12:59.630
now as you can see here this is a response or is a change of height was time we have here some overshoot

13:00.090 --> 13:04.560
in the system a city state after for example one second.

13:05.060 --> 13:08.860
So a final value which is almost all points three meter.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.210
Let's see what happens when we try to reduce the value of family fire.

13:13.640 --> 13:19.670
So I will go to m file and k a 2 for example 2.

13:19.940 --> 13:23.920
Now on the system closes

13:27.680 --> 13:28.910
and runs on model again

13:35.950 --> 13:42.550
now as you can see we have get rid of the solutions and also overshoot but we have another problem that

13:42.550 --> 13:50.250
we want the desired output to be 0 Boeing 3 but in our case it's all point to now let's see the effect

13:50.280 --> 13:59.150
of increasing the value of amplification 2 for example 90 now from

14:06.060 --> 14:14.880
by increasing the value of the amplification the maximum overshoot is increased and we're almost at

14:15.330 --> 14:18.330
0 point Steve was less serious to either

14:21.530 --> 14:22.620
that's all for this with you.

14:22.620 --> 14:27.210
Thank you guys for watching and seems an extra beat you don't forget to download this model from the

14:27.210 --> 14:28.230
nectar resources.
