00:00.810 --> 00:03.320
We'll come back to court record world.

00:03.850 --> 00:08.390
This video will show you how to implement the very damning coefficient in your model.

00:08.590 --> 00:13.240
I will lose it in the time domain molded by examining the forces the number exerted.

00:13.240 --> 00:18.790
We have two forces the force of number exerts you in compression of stroke and the force during what

00:18.790 --> 00:20.360
we call rebound stroke.

00:20.450 --> 00:24.920
And number in motion we exert these two forces because of a very simple reason.

00:25.030 --> 00:27.350
The number velocity changes over time.

00:27.370 --> 00:34.180
One important thing to keep in mind in real lives that mean coefficient is not constant the compression

00:34.210 --> 00:36.750
then being coefficients are different Zen.

00:36.810 --> 00:39.210
The rebound then being coefficients.

00:39.210 --> 00:44.710
And I'm saying coefficients not coefficient because of them being coefficient is changing with the speed

00:44.710 --> 00:45.410
also.

00:45.430 --> 00:51.790
So when you are building a system that includes a number you must have what we call dumper graph which

00:51.790 --> 00:58.000
shows the relation between numbers speed and forces exerted in post compression and rebounds talk for

00:58.000 --> 00:58.540
the quarter.

00:58.550 --> 01:04.480
Kamal does I have this table which relates the speed and the damage coefficient of the number I have

01:04.480 --> 01:07.940
used in post compression and rebounds strokes.

01:08.050 --> 01:15.360
So how I'm going to implement these data into my mold and I need to create a model and replace it with

01:15.360 --> 01:22.900
a number coefficient C once this model takes a number of speed as an input and produces a number coefficient

01:22.930 --> 01:23.990
as an output.

01:24.190 --> 01:29.470
How I will use it to look up tables for compression and rebound data.

01:29.470 --> 01:32.530
I will take a velocity signal if it's positive.

01:32.530 --> 01:35.410
I will use the compression table if it's negative.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.120
I will use the rebound table.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.990
Please note that my sign convention is plus for compression and minus 40 rebound.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.530
All of these necessary calculations will be done on a separate subsystem which I will use it in my main

01:47.530 --> 01:49.300
quarter car model system.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.900
So let's see that.

01:51.040 --> 01:58.830
As you can see these are the different values for the System variables I have added three lines at the

01:58.830 --> 01:59.370
end.

01:59.370 --> 02:05.740
I have added some velocity which is from twenty five onset to one hundred and fifty was a step off twenty

02:05.740 --> 02:12.080
five and I have added to information about the damping coefficient in pulse compression and rebounds

02:12.080 --> 02:16.200
strokes which are in these metrics.

02:16.310 --> 02:22.250
So now I have v c compression and c rebound.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.880
This is a quarter car model in the time domain.

02:26.070 --> 02:32.850
I need to replace the stumbling coefficient with a system that simulates as a variation of the coefficients

02:32.850 --> 02:37.180
of temping so I will go two blocks.

02:37.260 --> 02:44.090
I will search for subsystem and click enter right click Add to Untitled.

02:44.510 --> 02:49.630
This is my new subsystem which will replace the damaged coefficient.

02:49.630 --> 02:56.930
The subsystem takes input 1 and produces output 1 input 1 is the speed output one is a dumbbell coefficient

02:57.290 --> 03:05.550
I will double click the subsystem as you can see I have input 1 output 1 I will look at some later I

03:05.550 --> 03:21.350
will go 2 blocks lookup tables I will add one day lookup table signal rooting I will select switch meth

03:21.380 --> 03:29.400
operations APs and for demonstration I will add this play block

03:32.340 --> 03:37.780
and from commonly used blocks I will add constant.

03:37.860 --> 03:47.890
Now let's build a system I will drag them here.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.000
This is a first look up table.

03:50.370 --> 03:57.690
This lookup table will relate is the velocity with the damping coefficients in compression so peak points

03:57.840 --> 04:06.010
are velocity and this is the then mean coefficient in compression C on the score com.

04:06.480 --> 04:06.900
OK

04:11.860 --> 04:17.620
so as you can see I have added the different values for the compression that being coefficient was the

04:17.620 --> 04:18.160
speed

04:23.130 --> 04:24.510
I can rename this

04:31.170 --> 04:31.980
compression

04:37.400 --> 04:38.810
I will add another lookup table

04:47.050 --> 04:54.850
this lookup table will take V as breakpoints and see rebound now.

04:54.900 --> 04:55.370
Okay

04:59.970 --> 05:08.450
as you can see this or is a different values for them being coefficients with the speed okay.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.990
This is repellant

05:29.140 --> 05:30.260
now.

05:30.650 --> 05:41.780
This constant is for demonstration so for example if I have a speed of 25 the speed sign is plus I will

05:41.780 --> 05:50.360
feed this speed for the first time to absolute value block in order to take as a positive sign always

05:50.420 --> 05:51.410
of the speed

05:54.930 --> 06:01.530
if the speed is a minus which is rebound I will remove this sign to enter enters a table and takes a

06:01.530 --> 06:08.250
value in the appropriate way because we have a relation between the speed and the ending coefficients

06:08.370 --> 06:11.390
all in positive signs.

06:11.760 --> 06:16.300
So I will take another signal from here to the absolute.

06:17.610 --> 06:25.180
I will feed this signal to the first look up table which is compression and this one to the second lookup

06:25.180 --> 06:26.770
table which is rebound

06:30.120 --> 06:34.020
if I wired this display plug in post compression and rebound

06:38.770 --> 06:41.040
and try to run this model.

06:41.800 --> 06:48.640
As you can see in the first display which is the damping coefficient in compression I have twelve and

06:48.640 --> 06:50.650
the number coefficient in the rebound.

06:50.650 --> 06:56.290
I have for 2 different values for the them Uncle efficient which one is the correct one.

06:56.380 --> 07:01.350
This one is the correct one because the sign of the speed is plus twenty five.

07:02.890 --> 07:15.300
If for example the speed is minus 20 or minus twenty five okay what's will happen is I will take minus

07:15.300 --> 07:17.810
twenty five I will things absolute value of it.

07:17.940 --> 07:23.880
It's a twenty five I will enter this table and the answer will be twelve again.

07:24.060 --> 07:30.370
I will take minus twenty five absolute value which is twenty five I will enter city bound table and

07:30.370 --> 07:38.250
the answer is for which value is then Min coefficient is correct this time for is correct because the

07:38.250 --> 07:43.950
sign of the speed is in minus so this one is correct.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.850
So I've used a switch block in order to compare the speed with zero.

07:47.950 --> 07:53.120
If this be this bigger Zen zero I will think that I'm being coefficient from compression if this be

07:53.170 --> 08:02.050
this less than zero I will examine coefficient from rebound so I will whereas this here another signal

08:02.050 --> 08:11.400
here to make the comparison if it's through let's remove this display if it's through

08:14.750 --> 08:22.690
the upper signal will be executed if it falls the lower signal will be executed.

08:22.690 --> 08:29.560
Now I can add display on other display so sinks display

08:34.430 --> 08:41.570
now minus twenty five is a negative sign so minus twenty five is less than zero so I will take the signal

08:41.930 --> 08:44.410
of this damning coefficient from the rebound table.

08:44.450 --> 08:46.120
So let's run this model.

08:46.120 --> 08:57.900
The answer is for now I will remove this in this I will take this input and put one to the subsystem

08:58.360 --> 09:01.090
an hour between to the subsystem.

09:01.110 --> 09:02.880
Now I have built this model.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.330
This model takes a speed as an input and produces.

09:06.330 --> 09:12.960
So that mean coefficient as an output it compares between two different tables or two different values

09:12.960 --> 09:14.940
of the then being coefficients.

09:14.940 --> 09:20.040
The first table is a dumping coefficient in compression and the second table is a dumping coefficient

09:20.370 --> 09:24.120
and rebound depending on the sign of the velocity.

09:24.120 --> 09:33.080
We take the value of the then being coefficient I can go back to my main model.

09:33.080 --> 09:42.330
This is the subsystem I have used let's flip this block.

09:42.450 --> 09:45.510
Now what is input to this subsystem.

09:45.640 --> 09:52.260
Again if we look at this picture over December we will find that we have two different points we have

09:52.280 --> 09:59.710
this point that is connected to the Chelsea the speed or the velocity of this point is V C and we have

09:59.710 --> 10:06.760
this point that is connected to suspension system the speed or the velocity of this point is v is the

10:06.760 --> 10:13.410
force of this number is then Min coefficients time the difference between these two speed.

10:13.730 --> 10:21.670
So the input to the model I have created to simulate the varying damping coefficients is v c minus V

10:21.670 --> 10:29.080
is if we see a minus V is is in plus I will have compression so I will take the data from the lookup

10:29.080 --> 10:35.940
table of the compression that main coefficient if we see a minus V as is a minus I will take Zare bound

10:35.950 --> 10:42.430
dumping coefficient if you want an example for demonstration imagines that we is twenty five in this

10:42.430 --> 10:48.520
direction which is the compression direction so it's plus and V S is in the same direction but this

10:48.520 --> 10:57.040
time fifty deltas B equals to VCU minus V is so twenty five minus fifty equals to minus twenty five.

10:57.100 --> 11:03.850
So is this number is in rebound the stroke you can emissions at this point C is moving with twenty five

11:03.850 --> 11:12.520
mm per second but the S is moving was fifty millimeter per second so the S is leading V.S. so that number

11:12.520 --> 11:20.410
will be rebound not compressed and the forces then ember exerts is the relative velocity between these

11:20.410 --> 11:28.970
two points time zone then being coefficient if you want another example imagine that the C is also twenty

11:28.970 --> 11:33.670
five in this direction but this is fifty in another direction.

11:33.670 --> 11:44.770
So Delta V equals to twenty five minus minus fifty which is twenty five plus fifty equals to seventy

11:44.770 --> 11:45.450
five.

11:45.580 --> 11:53.590
So this number will be compressed relative his speed is seventy five or the speed of this chassis relative

11:53.590 --> 12:01.690
to the suspension mount and the force is a number exerts is seventy five millimeter per second times

12:01.690 --> 12:08.620
a damning coefficient this time the in coefficient from the compression table.

12:08.820 --> 12:16.590
Now back to our model what I need to make is to feed the relative speed of the chassis minus the suspension

12:16.590 --> 12:22.650
system into this subsystem so I will call business

12:26.420 --> 12:31.580
this is the speed of the suspension system and this is the speed of the chassis system so this is in

12:31.580 --> 12:32.090
plus

12:36.500 --> 12:37.790
and this is in minus

12:50.280 --> 12:57.250
so output is input 1 2 as a subsystem and subsystem will produces at them being coefficient.

12:57.260 --> 13:03.090
Now is this them being coefficient will be multiplied by the output of the signal.

13:03.500 --> 13:11.820
I need to delete C1 which is our constant dumping coefficient and I will remove the signal and also

13:11.820 --> 13:18.390
this one ends the output of this subsystem is a new damping coefficient.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.470
I will add from MSA operation product

13:26.720 --> 13:33.780
I'll drag it here as a product Block takes to signal and multiply them together.

13:34.030 --> 13:38.700
So I will flip this block.

13:38.780 --> 13:41.230
This is the first signal.

13:41.390 --> 13:42.430
This is the second one

13:45.500 --> 13:54.220
and the output is fitted to this point and another signal is speed it to this point.

13:56.060 --> 14:01.860
If you are confused you can check modelling and simulation of course our car model in time to mean now.

14:01.970 --> 14:11.770
Our model is ready to run and simulate run double click here to see the response of the suspension system.

14:11.800 --> 14:20.870
We have some oscillations here on some damped and this is the response of the chassis.

14:21.150 --> 14:25.950
If you want to see the variation of the damage coefficient was time I will copy the scope

14:28.500 --> 14:29.940
and I will take the signal

14:32.620 --> 14:36.660
now run.

14:37.100 --> 14:42.800
As you can see that the main coefficient is not constant over time it's changing based on whether it's

14:42.800 --> 14:51.930
compression or rebound and based on the speed and if you want also to see how the speed changes will

14:51.950 --> 15:02.470
take signal from here fitted to the scoop and run and this is the speed it goes from positive signs

15:02.470 --> 15:04.240
to negative signs and so on.

15:06.070 --> 15:09.480
Thank you guys for watching and see you in the next three to.
