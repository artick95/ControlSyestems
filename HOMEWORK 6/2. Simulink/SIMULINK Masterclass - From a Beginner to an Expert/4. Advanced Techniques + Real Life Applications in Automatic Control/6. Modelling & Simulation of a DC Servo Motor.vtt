00:00.760 --> 00:03.920
Modelling and simulation of a DC servo motor.

00:05.410 --> 00:13.490
So first what is it easy servo motor and you see several motor is as simple a DC motor.

00:13.580 --> 00:19.340
Plus what we call several mechanism servo mechanism is used to control the output of the DC motor

00:22.810 --> 00:25.280
from your electric class.

00:25.420 --> 00:32.130
We have here what we call state or the state or produces CONSTANT MAGNETIC FIELD And we have here a

00:32.170 --> 00:34.070
router which is a coil.

00:34.180 --> 00:40.660
Once the current flows inside this coil an electromagnetic force is induced according to law and slow

00:41.230 --> 00:44.650
and the coil starts to rotate.

00:44.830 --> 00:49.300
Very simple.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.450
So what is the servo mechanism.

00:52.540 --> 00:57.370
First we have years of two circuits of the DC motor.

00:57.370 --> 01:05.110
We have what we call our metro circuit which is input voltage and we have resistance and then inductor

01:05.890 --> 01:12.720
we have Becky MF and this is the shaft of the motor which is connected to another shaft towards output.

01:12.750 --> 01:19.270
There may be for example gears ends output shaft has and there she is a and then been coefficient of

01:19.270 --> 01:27.490
B so we have a Ludes owns a shaft legs and their sheer force and to them being force the torque produces

01:27.520 --> 01:33.610
on the shaft is proportional to the current flows inside the circuit and we have here is a field circuit.

01:33.610 --> 01:39.400
You are not interested into the field circuit because we will use our motor circuit as a control process

01:40.090 --> 01:44.210
in order to control the output of this DC motor.

01:44.210 --> 01:52.060
Based on Zane wood which means what is the voltage you need to supply it to this DC motor in order to

01:52.060 --> 01:54.440
have certain high speed or a certain position.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.890
We use the servo mechanism so we have here our DC motor.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.440
This is the shaft of the DC motor and we have here two gears.

02:02.510 --> 02:03.830
There is odd wood shaft.

02:03.880 --> 02:10.450
We put the sensor on this output shaft like a potential meter in order to sense for example the speed

02:10.450 --> 02:11.210
of this shaft.

02:11.240 --> 02:17.590
The potential meter is converting is this a speed signal into a voltage signal and we feedback this

02:17.590 --> 02:20.380
voltage signal in amplifier.

02:20.710 --> 02:23.990
We have here also an input from any source.

02:23.980 --> 02:30.210
The difference between the output and the input voltages is amplified and this is error and is feeding

02:30.230 --> 02:37.540
back to the control unit of the DC motor which is placed on this signal correct is on but of that you

02:37.540 --> 02:41.020
see motor based on the application or is a desired output.

02:41.470 --> 02:48.190
So we have three main components here we have the control unit all the work is done inside this control

02:48.190 --> 02:55.540
unit we have output sensor which is for example potential meter and we have a feedback signal so let's

02:55.540 --> 03:03.400
see the most medical modelling of the DC motor by applying care should slow on the circuit.

03:03.400 --> 03:12.580
We have the input voltage or the reference input here V equals to r plus l i dot plus the back E and

03:12.610 --> 03:20.440
F E and the back IMF is proportional to the speed of the shaft so equals to a constant we call K.B.

03:20.760 --> 03:27.730
times see to that that work is proportional to the current flows inside the circuit so torque equals

03:27.730 --> 03:35.730
to Katy Times ie and from the free body diagram of the output shaft we have to work equals 2 and their

03:35.750 --> 03:43.900
shallow GC A lot plus then being lowered b c the load by taking a less transformation of these four

03:43.900 --> 03:53.180
equations we have V S equals two ie times are plus S L plus Becky M F Becky M F equals two Coniston

03:53.200 --> 03:59.630
key B times C to that and actually I've kept C that up because I won't are going to be a velocity in

03:59.650 --> 04:07.330
my position you can replace C a lot by Omega for example if you'll get confused we have to work equals

04:07.330 --> 04:14.920
to Katy Times I and we have to work equals to see the other times J as plus B so the input is this voltage

04:15.010 --> 04:21.250
and the output is a seat a lot as an assignment I want you to draw the block diagram of these equations

04:21.680 --> 04:27.640
the input is V and the output is see the dot and you will find the answer and as domain modelling of

04:27.640 --> 04:28.480
the DC motor

04:33.630 --> 04:41.790
so how to model this DC motor using Samuel link I have arranged the motor equations to be like this

04:43.080 --> 04:52.230
I thought equals to one over l times V minus I R minus E so I will start by signal I thought I will

04:52.230 --> 04:56.760
integrate the signal first time in order to have I and I will feed I.

04:56.760 --> 05:05.040
Times are back and this signal would be minus the Becky M F plus the input voltage to producers I idled

05:06.520 --> 05:12.690
by producing GUI you can multiplied by Katie in order to have the talk and from the to work you can

05:12.690 --> 05:17.970
have see the double lot and from sea level a lot you can have see the lot and feedback see the dot in

05:17.970 --> 05:23.640
order to have the back IMF is very simple and when you look at the symbol link you will understand more

05:24.030 --> 05:30.910
so let's move to the symbol link I've created a new model and the semi link I have m file which contains

05:30.910 --> 05:37.440
the different values for the different variables we have years of resistance we have inductor we have

05:37.440 --> 05:43.380
the kind of son Katie K.B. and we have them in coefficients and in their shows the shaft

05:46.630 --> 05:54.810
so from commonly use block I will add the scoop gain and some point

05:59.050 --> 06:06.640
and from continuous I will end and integrate integrator and from sources I will add a constant for example

06:13.990 --> 06:15.310
let's arrange these blocks

06:20.240 --> 06:21.440
leads is a scoop

06:24.350 --> 06:30.630
so by looking at the equation we have here is a signal I dot

06:34.810 --> 06:40.060
this is the signal light dot so I will type I thought

06:43.580 --> 06:53.890
by integrating I dot for the first time we will have I so the signal here is the current I multiplied

06:53.890 --> 06:58.210
by the resistance I would flip this block

07:01.820 --> 07:02.780
and this is r

07:14.110 --> 07:19.390
from the second equation if we multiplied ie by Coniston Kate we will produce a talk.

07:19.510 --> 07:22.060
So I will copy this block and flip

07:24.780 --> 07:25.890
this is Katie

07:35.470 --> 07:42.590
ends up with signal here is tea or is at work from the third equation.

07:42.640 --> 07:50.380
The talk signal minus B C the dot plus one over J produces a seat to the bill but so this is a summation

07:50.380 --> 07:50.880
point

07:57.110 --> 08:04.450
I would keep it like that and we have to work in plus and see to love a lot of minus

08:07.320 --> 08:18.250
czar but of the signal would be multiplied by one over J So I would call this block here and this is

08:18.250 --> 08:19.020
one over J

08:25.610 --> 08:28.280
to produce C to the ballot.

08:28.400 --> 08:34.130
So if I integrated the signal of C that I will look for the first time it will produce a seat about

08:35.470 --> 08:39.510
that's fit to view.

08:39.800 --> 08:40.700
This is here

08:43.910 --> 08:47.730
theta or up a lot.

08:52.700 --> 08:59.730
And the integration is a citadel which is my output so I will use a scoop in order to please output.

08:59.860 --> 09:03.010
This is theta dot

09:05.900 --> 09:12.570
and ppl looking at the third equation say the dot is multiplied by B.

09:13.040 --> 09:17.620
So I will copy this block and this is B

09:20.780 --> 09:29.030
and talk minus p c to dot times 1 over J produces a C to double dot

09:32.000 --> 09:33.440
again from the last equation

09:37.780 --> 09:47.210
C to that is multiplied by so I will Kobe's this block just right click and drag it

09:51.060 --> 09:54.200
and I will do the wearing.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.430
This is P.

09:58.170 --> 10:00.530
And I will add the submission point.

10:02.190 --> 10:04.410
So I will copy this.

10:04.410 --> 10:15.730
This for example here they'll make a rectangle and I will add three signs plus sign for the input minus

10:15.730 --> 10:19.780
signs for I or a minus sign for Peck IMF.

10:22.640 --> 10:30.380
Sorry this is K.B. so seat of the times KP produces the back Bank IMF

10:33.380 --> 10:39.940
is fit to view I would enlarge this.

10:40.020 --> 10:47.000
This is the same signal maybe a Coniston signal of like 5

10:50.600 --> 10:55.740
and this is a Bank IMF and this is all I or

11:02.710 --> 11:08.020
ends odd would signal of this summing point is multiplied by

11:11.810 --> 11:12.740
one over L

11:16.510 --> 11:17.320
to produce.

11:17.320 --> 11:17.950
I dot

11:22.820 --> 11:23.160
now.

11:23.200 --> 11:31.110
We have completed our model so I can earn my model now it will take some time

11:39.040 --> 11:52.790
you can track the simulation time from here so we are at that time equals to 5.5.

11:53.190 --> 11:53.850
Now we are done.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.890
I can double click here on the scoop in order to seize the output of the system

12:04.240 --> 12:05.930
with scale.

12:06.450 --> 12:10.840
So this is output velocity was time.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.650
Thank you guys for watching and I will see you in the next video.
