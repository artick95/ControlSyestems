00:00.150 --> 00:01.110
Welcome back guys.

00:01.290 --> 00:07.710
So in this video I'm going to talk about tank control problem and actually I will cover this topic in

00:07.710 --> 00:09.460
three different lecture.

00:09.580 --> 00:14.880
The first lecture we are going to do is a mathematical modelling of the hang control system and we are

00:14.880 --> 00:19.110
going to do the simulation by using some link in the next lecture.

00:19.110 --> 00:24.390
We are going to add a control system which is proportional controller and I will show you how to do

00:24.390 --> 00:30.420
this by using semi link and in later lecture when I talk about pure idea controller I will use this

00:30.420 --> 00:35.420
system as an application.

00:35.650 --> 00:37.450
We have here a simple tank.

00:37.540 --> 00:43.770
This one here right of this thing is etch which is changing with time.

00:43.810 --> 00:53.160
This thing has a capacitance C or area equals to a Q2 is being provided to this thing PI an input see

00:53.160 --> 00:54.040
the V.

00:54.040 --> 01:01.140
So we have a shuttle here and we are opening or closing the throttle was a speed CTV Dot.

01:01.530 --> 01:08.830
There is a constant here K V which represents the relation between the speed of the throttle and the

01:08.830 --> 01:10.490
flow rate.

01:10.510 --> 01:16.500
So here we will have an equation Q2 flows inside this thing and the thing is being felt.

01:16.510 --> 01:26.710
So h changes and Q one leaves this thing two is throttle with resistance R so it's a very simple problem.

01:26.830 --> 01:29.410
Now let's see the mathematical equations we have here.

01:29.410 --> 01:38.820
The first equation from here we have the constant K V Q two equals two K V Times seat of adult.

01:38.980 --> 01:39.910
The second equation

01:42.440 --> 01:45.720
Q2 minus Q one equals two.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.960
Area of this tank.

01:46.970 --> 01:51.220
Times H dot or the change of the thing kind.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.520
Continue with the equation

01:55.270 --> 02:02.110
sir the equation of the shuttle we have q 1 which enters the shuttle times the slope of the resistance

02:02.500 --> 02:04.900
equals 2 height.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.660
Three basic equations.

02:06.670 --> 02:17.680
So we have the input here which is see the V and the output here is etch so sit Sylvie as an input is

02:17.680 --> 02:28.390
multiplied by k v to produce Q2 and Q2 minus eight times each dot to produce Q1 Q1 is multiplied by

02:28.390 --> 02:36.010
our to produce Etch Etch is differentiated to produce etch dot which is fitted back in order to have

02:36.220 --> 02:36.980
Q1.

02:37.030 --> 02:46.450
So let's see that on similar link as you can see I have created a new model and Samuel link from the

02:46.450 --> 02:47.010
LEI period.

02:47.020 --> 03:00.660
I will add from commonly used blocks scoop some and they'll let gain and from continuous I will add

03:00.660 --> 03:06.360
derivative and from sources I will add ramp source

03:11.400 --> 03:12.830
now back to the system

03:22.460 --> 03:29.660
by looking at the equations we have CW dot as an input so I have choose ramp input which represents

03:29.720 --> 03:37.540
the change of throttle angle with time CTV the times K V equals to Q2.

03:38.010 --> 03:45.710
So I have an m file this m file contains a different values for the different system parameters K V

03:45.710 --> 03:51.190
equals to 0 point or 1 meter cubed per second per it.

03:51.200 --> 04:00.170
So 1 read makes metric cubed per second flows inside the system the Volt resistance R equals 2 0 point

04:00.170 --> 04:09.170
to 5 second over M squared and we have the tank area equals two point eight metres squared.

04:09.170 --> 04:21.660
Now back to our model this is the ramp input or CTV dot as multiplied by k v so double click here and

04:21.660 --> 04:33.110
this is K C to produce Q2 Q2 is then subtracted from x times a.

04:33.110 --> 04:38.130
So double click here plus and minus

04:42.590 --> 04:54.950
and we have here in the signal a Times etch so I will copy another gain right click flip this one here

04:55.040 --> 04:59.020
a and I would wear it

05:03.000 --> 05:12.710
to produce Q1 Q1 is then multiplied by the stroke of the resistance to produce etch.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.100
So this is another gain

05:17.830 --> 05:19.110
double click.

05:19.140 --> 05:23.080
This is r and r what is etch.

05:23.640 --> 05:36.530
And it will be plotted using the scoop and I will take signals from etch flip this block the signal

05:36.530 --> 05:46.340
will be differentiated to have etch not an etch dot times a to produce a Times etch dot which is in

05:46.340 --> 05:53.190
subtracted from Q2 to produce Q1 Q1 times are to produce etch.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.500
Now let's simulate this system.

05:55.530 --> 06:06.340
I'll change this time to 5 and go back to my end file clerk run now as you can see I have different

06:06.340 --> 06:15.510
values of the different parameters in the workspace so I can run my model without any errors now run

06:17.320 --> 06:20.000
double click on the scoop to see the response

06:23.010 --> 06:28.950
as you can see as a time increased the height of this tank is increased also.

06:29.250 --> 06:33.600
So if they're five seconds we have a height of twelve millimeters

06:39.040 --> 06:47.590
I can change a slope of the frame input in order to increase the change of the opening evolve angular

06:47.590 --> 06:49.070
position was time.

06:49.180 --> 06:54.890
So for example five apply and OK now run

07:00.520 --> 07:07.000
as you can see the final height of the thing is increase to 60 millimeters.

07:07.150 --> 07:08.650
That's all for this video.

07:08.650 --> 07:09.760
Thank you guys for watching.

07:09.770 --> 07:15.920
In the next video we're going to see how to control the system by using proportional controller.

07:15.970 --> 07:17.320
So see you there.
