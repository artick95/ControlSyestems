00:01.690 --> 00:06.850
Let's see another example which will help you to get familiar with smuggling and also will enhance your

00:06.850 --> 00:09.340
thinking in modeling problems.

00:09.340 --> 00:15.150
This is a spring damper system from the previous section was a but here is a displacement x.

00:15.280 --> 00:21.860
This displacement moves as a spring K and as a result the mass moves a displacement y and also there

00:21.860 --> 00:28.240
is a number which resist the motion we have drive the equation of system as m y the blot blasts see

00:28.240 --> 00:36.260
white dot plus K Y equals two K X. What we are going to do in this video is building the symbol link

00:36.280 --> 00:39.490
multiple of this system and simulated with an input.

00:39.490 --> 00:46.170
For example a step inputs in order to build this model we need first to think how to relate to output

00:46.180 --> 00:48.010
to the input of this system.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.950
The first step of relating is the output of the system to the input is to write the equation of motion

00:54.040 --> 01:02.860
in the form of why the blue dot equals to 1 over M times K X minus C Y dot minus K Y.

01:02.860 --> 01:03.900
Now think about it.

01:03.940 --> 01:08.660
If we integrated y the block two times we will get the output y.

01:08.680 --> 01:14.140
This is the left hand side and you can easily build the right hand side each time you'll make the integration.

01:14.140 --> 01:20.560
So after integrating y level DOT for the first time we guns a Wyandotte signal we can take the signal

01:20.620 --> 01:28.800
and multiplied by a gain which is C or is it then being coefficient and feed it back to a summing point.

01:29.230 --> 01:35.860
Similarly after integrating y double lot for the second time we got Y and then multiplied by again K

01:35.950 --> 01:42.520
which is the stiffness of the spring and feed it back to the summing point adding all of this was inputs

01:42.610 --> 01:50.980
X will complete the model so let's see Z in the symbol link as you can see I have built and you model

01:51.040 --> 01:55.810
and from the late Peri common use blocks I will add an integrator

01:59.010 --> 02:05.640
and I would copy at so we can use one to integrate why the blocks and the other want to integrate why

02:05.630 --> 02:07.490
it ought to get Y.

02:07.650 --> 02:13.730
Now I will add three gains for 1 over M C and K.

02:13.770 --> 02:22.760
Again this is very simple just drag and drop one block and copy paste the others I will drag this guy

02:22.760 --> 02:26.480
here into forward path and make is a wiring

02:29.470 --> 02:36.940
and others are for the feedback signals so I need to reverse or flip the directions of this plug simply

02:37.030 --> 02:42.610
by right click ziplock select rotate them flap and flap ziplock

02:52.100 --> 02:57.860
now I will do the wiring the first one take the signal from the integration of why they will not which

02:57.860 --> 02:58.910
is why not.

02:59.180 --> 03:06.140
So this game is a damping see the other one takes the signal from the integration of y dot.

03:06.230 --> 03:15.620
So this is a gain of stiffness k now as you can see in the right hand side of the equation I have built

03:15.770 --> 03:24.020
these terms K Y and see why adult to complete the forward path I will add a scoop to show the graph

03:24.020 --> 03:24.830
of the output

03:33.760 --> 03:35.800
and I will add a summing point

03:44.180 --> 03:51.350
I will double click the summing point and change its shape to rectangle very easy and I will make it

03:51.350 --> 03:59.000
something sorry signals the first signal is positive and the second and third signals are negative

04:05.500 --> 04:11.070
again by looking at the equation I need to subtract these two signals from each other.

04:11.110 --> 04:16.200
So I will drag these two signals to the negative sign in the summing point.

04:16.210 --> 04:23.510
Now I need to add an input which represents x of t and this input is multiplied by stiffness case.

04:23.510 --> 04:28.270
So first I will drag and drop a gain and completes the wiring

04:34.030 --> 04:35.110
now for the inputs.

04:35.110 --> 04:38.790
I will use as tip input from sources blocks.

04:38.800 --> 04:43.180
I will drag and drop step source and wire it to the game plan

04:48.170 --> 04:49.340
to complete the model.

04:49.340 --> 04:52.280
We need to define the values of the gains.

04:52.280 --> 05:01.460
So assumes that the mass equals to 25 kg then being coefficients C equal to one hundred and fifty Newton

05:01.490 --> 05:07.480
times second over meter the stiffness equals to forty K Newton perimeter.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.310
So this game is 1 over m.

05:09.320 --> 05:19.870
So 1 over 25 this guy here is 150.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.160
This one is forty K

05:24.880 --> 05:31.540
and the last one which is also k equals to forty k.

05:31.760 --> 05:39.010
Now another look at the model we have built the input x which is a step input is multiplied by K and

05:39.020 --> 05:45.680
is feed it to the summing point and then sub a circuit from these two signals which are why the time

05:45.680 --> 05:55.160
C and Y times K Z result signal is in multiplied by one over m to get Y the Bulldogs now integrate y

05:55.180 --> 06:03.290
the blue dot for the first time to get y dot you can feed the signal back and Y is integrated to Y which

06:03.290 --> 06:08.410
is angled and again we can complete the model by feeding this signal back.

06:08.450 --> 06:12.200
Finally a scoop is used to show the result.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.600
This is a step m but so I can double click it to change its properties.

06:16.760 --> 06:22.340
For example this is a unit step but I can change this number to any other number.

06:22.430 --> 06:24.740
Now let's run this model and see as a result.

06:24.770 --> 06:28.550
But first I will reduce a simulating time to 5 seconds

06:38.640 --> 06:44.200
the system behavior is shown in the figure as there are some oscillations in the system which are reduced

06:44.200 --> 06:46.420
by time until disappear.
