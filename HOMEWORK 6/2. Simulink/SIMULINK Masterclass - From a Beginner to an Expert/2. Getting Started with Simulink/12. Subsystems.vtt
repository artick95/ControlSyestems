00:00.270 --> 00:02.880
Subsystems and more complex modelling.

00:02.880 --> 00:09.960
We may need to make subsystems which means you take a part off your model to create a subsystems that

00:09.960 --> 00:11.820
has a certain function.

00:11.820 --> 00:18.500
Your pig model can now be reduced to some small modules that have inputs and produce outputs.

00:18.510 --> 00:20.980
For example the transmission system of a car.

00:21.030 --> 00:28.800
We may have an input from the engine that enters a subsystem of a gearbox and the object goes to another

00:28.800 --> 00:31.700
subsystem which is a differential and so on.

00:31.710 --> 00:34.310
So how to make is subsystem.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.830
Here we have what we call a p idea controller.

00:37.830 --> 00:43.500
If you're not familiar with the p idea controller you can check that patch PDA if any way.

00:43.500 --> 00:49.580
Consider this like any other system and we want to create a subsystem from this system.

00:49.650 --> 00:57.810
Just select all the system right click Create some system from selections or control plus e.g. now a

00:57.810 --> 00:59.400
subsystem is created.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.050
If I double click the system you will find our old systems API view controller.

01:04.050 --> 01:11.610
You will notice that two more plots were added to the system inputs one or in one block and output one

01:11.730 --> 01:16.680
block in subsystem we cannot leave the inputs and outputs signals empty.

01:16.770 --> 01:23.140
So we add or similar link automatically add these blocks which are referenced in our model.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.550
As you can see there is input 1 and output 1.

01:26.550 --> 01:33.990
So when we add input in our project it will be runs a subsystem without any problem and output one will

01:33.990 --> 01:37.730
be taken from this subsystem to our project.

01:37.830 --> 01:42.900
There is another way to make subsystems simply by adding a subsystem plug.

01:43.260 --> 01:46.350
If you want to find it quickly search for subsystem

01:49.150 --> 01:51.460
right click Add to Untitled.

01:51.580 --> 02:02.730
Now for example I can create my module inside the system or simply copy and paste an existing one I

02:02.730 --> 02:10.080
will delete those inputs and outputs signals and my input and output signals to my second systems are

02:10.080 --> 02:12.000
input to an output to.
