00:00.270 --> 00:04.170
Dealing with mattresses in Samuel Inc as Samuel his Matlab pays.

00:04.230 --> 00:11.070
It's not surprising that there's a big support for use of matrices and Multi-dimensional arrays that

00:11.070 --> 00:12.080
sees it.

00:12.090 --> 00:13.410
I will add a game blog

00:16.180 --> 00:17.170
constant pluck

00:20.090 --> 00:21.890
and display block

00:26.330 --> 00:33.860
now wears them together to produce simple model which could have some pluck is multiplied by game pluck

00:33.940 --> 00:39.920
and the result is displayed on display to block the input of the Coniston block can be customized to

00:39.920 --> 00:47.720
be in metrics was the same notation of the matlab for example one comma to semicolon eight comma nine

00:47.720 --> 00:56.730
to produce a matrix which is two times two by the same manner the game block for example nine semicolon

00:56.780 --> 00:57.270
five

01:00.200 --> 01:06.740
senses are two signals are now matrices that are multiplied to each other we need to define the multiplication

01:06.740 --> 01:07.400
method.

01:07.400 --> 01:13.400
This can be done by editing is a game block from multiplication we can select from different options

01:13.400 --> 01:19.460
like element by element multiplication which requires post matrices to have the same dimensions and

01:19.460 --> 01:24.920
the matrix multiplication which requires a number of columns of the first Matrix equals to the number

01:24.920 --> 01:27.080
of rows of the second metrics.

01:27.230 --> 01:32.560
There are also option like you times K or K times you view.

01:32.570 --> 01:36.820
Here is a constant signal and k is the gain signal.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.240
So for now I will select you times.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.790
K OK

01:45.830 --> 01:46.760
now run

01:52.740 --> 02:00.780
again I can change the game clock input to 1 Comma 2 semicolon 8 comma 8 OK

02:03.790 --> 02:04.800
and Arun

02:08.290 --> 02:15.210
Now let's try the element y's multiplication option okay from.

02:15.420 --> 02:23.650
So now each element is multiplied to each corresponding one from the other metrics another plug to deal

02:23.650 --> 02:31.530
with matrices is assignment block which could be found in the maze blocks library or simply by timing

02:31.620 --> 02:33.020
assignment in the search

02:38.490 --> 02:45.310
assignment block is used to replace a certain element in a matrix pi another predefined number let's

02:45.330 --> 02:51.720
see that I will copy the Coniston blocks from the previous model simply by right click and drag them

02:51.900 --> 02:52.690
twice.

02:52.740 --> 03:00.660
Also I will copy the display plug I will change the input of this block to one comment to comma 3 comma

03:00.720 --> 03:06.750
4 comma 5 and I will feed it to y node signal of the assignment plug

03:11.310 --> 03:20.980
I will change this one to fifty and I will feed it to you signal to decide which element to replace

03:21.040 --> 03:24.790
just change as index 2 for example 3

03:28.670 --> 03:37.560
runs a model as you can see is a service element is replaced with 50 there are some other plugs to deal

03:37.560 --> 03:43.350
with matrices like some of elements productive elements minimum and makes

03:50.190 --> 03:53.190
I will add Coniston pluck and display plug.

03:58.070 --> 04:05.020
I will cop it three times I will change the end but to one comma to commissary coma for

04:10.130 --> 04:13.400
this one to two coma 6 7 0

04:20.720 --> 04:24.470
and this guy here to 1 commit to commissary coma 6

04:32.150 --> 04:38.330
let's copy this minimum and maximum block so I can make one clock minimum and as a clock maximum and

04:38.360 --> 04:39.230
another game clock

04:42.280 --> 04:44.950
minus one minus two minus three minus four

04:47.850 --> 04:51.960
I'll probably display block four times and wire all the models

05:01.280 --> 05:11.250
and I'll change this guy here to maximum now from as you can see the first model the maximum of negative

05:11.250 --> 05:17.310
one negative two negative three negative four is negative one does a minimum of one two three four is

05:17.400 --> 05:27.570
one so product of two comma six comma seven comma zero is zero and the sum of one two three six is twelve.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.190
In case you have for example two times two metrics.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.610
In this case you have two dimensions column dimension and row dimension.

05:35.610 --> 05:42.480
For example one comma two semicolon five comma six I need to specify a direction which is a sum block

05:42.480 --> 05:43.740
will operate on.

05:43.770 --> 05:47.890
So from option some.

05:47.890 --> 05:54.340
Over specified dimension I will select two to sum over rows

05:57.760 --> 05:58.500
as output.

05:58.500 --> 06:06.990
In this case is sry which is a sum of the first row and eleven which is a sum of the second row.
