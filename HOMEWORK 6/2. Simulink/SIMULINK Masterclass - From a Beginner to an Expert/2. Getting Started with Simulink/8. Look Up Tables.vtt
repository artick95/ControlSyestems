Lookup tables in some cases you may want to produce an output based on a tables that relates as input

00:07.840 --> 00:09.640
signals to the output.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.890
Let me give you an example from a real life.

00:13.030 --> 00:19.900
If we are modelling for example the suspension system of a vehicle actually then been coefficient of

00:19.900 --> 00:22.480
the number is not constant.

00:22.480 --> 00:29.910
It's changing paste on the numbers speed so at each time you need to choose a value of them being coefficient

00:29.920 --> 00:34.570
from a graph that relates the speed was of them being coefficient.

00:34.580 --> 00:41.810
I hope this example was clear one day lookup look up table and different lookup tables can be found

00:41.870 --> 00:43.790
in lookup table library

00:46.690 --> 00:54.000
right click and add to untitled double click to check the options of the lookup table in the table data

00:54.070 --> 01:02.860
you type the relation between the input and output for example change of negative five to five pick

01:02.860 --> 01:11.050
points which are the inputs negative five comma five for example can also at the table manually from

01:11.050 --> 01:11.570
here.

01:11.680 --> 01:17.770
As you can see the different table values are shown can also define two variables in MATLAB workspace

01:17.890 --> 01:24.770
and add them here in the table data and peak points let's try this table.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.040
I will add some pluck

01:28.730 --> 01:33.660
display pluck now while everything

01:36.510 --> 01:47.370
changes and 12 for example five and run as output is 0 point 9 9 9 9 which is the same as the value

01:47.370 --> 01:48.870
found on the table

01:52.590 --> 01:59.910
the best saying about lookup tables that it can interpolate if the input signal are between the table

01:59.910 --> 02:02.550
values for example 4.5

02:06.360 --> 02:13.110
and also it can extrapolate if the input is out of range for example 6

02:15.960 --> 02:18.220
so output signal is 1.
