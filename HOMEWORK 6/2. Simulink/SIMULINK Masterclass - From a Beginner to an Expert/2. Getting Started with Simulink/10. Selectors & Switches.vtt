Selectors and switches select road blocks are used to select defined elements from for example Victor.

00:07.880 --> 00:15.800
Let's see how selector can be found in signal routing blocks library double click and add to Untitled

00:18.670 --> 00:20.590
I will add Coniston block

00:26.530 --> 00:27.640
display block

00:30.970 --> 00:32.140
wires and together

00:37.830 --> 00:42.720
I'll change the constant to for example mind comma eight comma zero comma two

00:46.750 --> 00:48.610
to customize this electoral block.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.770
Double click.

00:49.810 --> 00:53.920
First we need to tell the blog and the input signal has for but

00:57.780 --> 01:00.780
to define the index of which element to choose.

01:00.780 --> 01:05.850
For example one comma to to select the first and second element.

01:05.850 --> 01:12.510
You can select the index option to be zero based to come from zero or 1 based to account from 1

01:15.470 --> 01:27.690
now run as you can see 8 and 9 switches switches are used just like if statements in programming but

01:27.710 --> 01:36.230
was some limitation and certain ways to use in order to use switches from signal routing and switch

01:36.230 --> 01:41.140
block multipoint switch and manual switch

01:43.740 --> 01:44.850
constant pluck.

01:48.350 --> 01:49.340
This play plunk

01:52.970 --> 01:54.590
I will add also step block

01:57.710 --> 02:01.810
sine wave block scoop

02:13.630 --> 02:20.320
switch block a second on this feed it to center point of the switch block in which a comparison is performed

02:20.320 --> 02:27.660
between this signal and a threshold it can be bigger than or equal bigger then or almost equal.

02:27.670 --> 02:29.710
This threshold is added from here.

02:29.710 --> 02:31.340
For example five.

02:31.390 --> 02:34.900
Now let's make a simple model and rise this block.

02:34.900 --> 02:42.290
I will Colby's a kind of some pluck three times I will change the input of this block to zero

02:45.090 --> 02:51.900
this one to five in which I will compare relative to it and I will leave this guy one I will wear the

02:51.900 --> 02:56.940
six kind of some pluck to the center point of the switch block it is a compressor is through the output

02:56.940 --> 03:01.260
signal will be the upper signal a folds it will be the lower signal

03:07.130 --> 03:15.990
now run six is bigger than five so the output signal is zero let's compare to five.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.440
Can you think of the output

03:21.580 --> 03:29.730
through the output is one manual switch manual switch select between two signals by simply double clicks

03:29.730 --> 03:36.850
a block for example suppose that you have built its system and you want to try two inputs like step

03:36.880 --> 03:44.290
input on sine wave input simply add a manual switch why a pulse signal to it and double click to switch

03:44.290 --> 03:45.640
between the two signals

03:57.140 --> 04:03.280
multiple ports switch an integer on the top of the multi port switch their minds which of the rest of

04:03.280 --> 04:09.850
the elements will be connected to the output if the top input is for example 1 the first of these inputs

04:09.910 --> 04:15.540
will be selected as the top input is to the second of these inputs is selected and so on.

04:15.760 --> 04:21.400
Let's say an example I will double click a block and change the number of data points to 4

04:25.630 --> 04:31.960
copies a display block and where it copy for constant plucks and wires them

04:51.150 --> 04:56.170
I will change these values to mind minus nine

05:01.810 --> 05:11.100
zero now it is the first constant is ones in the first input is selected which is nine let's try for

05:15.040 --> 05:16.090
zero as selected.
