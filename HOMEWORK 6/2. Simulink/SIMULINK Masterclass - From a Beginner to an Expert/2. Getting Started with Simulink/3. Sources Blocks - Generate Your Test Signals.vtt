This lecture covers some of the sources blocks in Syria link as I stated before each system has an input

00:07.230 --> 00:13.590
and produces an output is a relation between inputs and outputs is the transfer function.

00:13.590 --> 00:20.670
For example imagine this vehicle and your as engineer has spelled a similarly ink module which simulates

00:20.670 --> 00:23.310
is a suspension system motion of this vehicle.

00:23.310 --> 00:29.200
Now imagine you want to feed an input to the system for example to simulate the bumps in the road.

00:29.220 --> 00:34.160
These inputs could be sine wave or a step function.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.700
The sources or inputs are found in sources blocks in simulating

00:42.020 --> 00:49.040
and as you can see I have created six models to show you six different types of sources.

00:49.070 --> 00:54.590
The first one is a step function the step function or step input gives a sudden change to a certain

00:54.590 --> 00:56.870
value in almost no time.

00:56.870 --> 01:03.030
So first we need to define the time base before this step action which is called step time.

01:03.050 --> 01:09.610
In our example step time equals to 1 and let's change the step final value to 5.

01:09.620 --> 01:16.520
So if this is the displacement for example this means after 1 second the displacement will jump suddenly

01:16.580 --> 01:20.350
to 5 units in no time and continues.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.770
Now let's run and see.

01:23.990 --> 01:28.930
This is a step time which is one second and the step equals 2 5.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.260
After this step time

01:33.250 --> 01:38.740
ramp input for example is a step and both represents a sudden displacement ramp.

01:38.750 --> 01:45.450
Input represents Z velocity is a displacement increases by one unit in one second.

01:45.460 --> 01:49.620
This means a slope of 1 in 0 and parameters.

01:49.690 --> 01:50.590
Let's see that

01:54.900 --> 02:02.400
as shown in the graph after 1 second the displacement increased 1 unit or after 2 seconds is a displacement

02:02.430 --> 02:12.250
increased 2 units the circled input is a sine wave and we have explained it before the sine wave general

02:12.250 --> 02:22.000
equation is amplitude times sine of frequency plus time times phase plus pious and you can change the

02:22.000 --> 02:23.910
different prompters from this window.

02:31.640 --> 02:38.490
A random number source this is produces a random number you can change the parameters like mean variance

02:38.630 --> 02:44.870
seed and finally is a sample time or the time this blocks produces a random number.

02:44.880 --> 02:50.250
In this example is a random number source produces a random number after 1 second

02:53.430 --> 03:02.130
so as you can see in this plot there is a random number each second repeating sequence source.

03:02.220 --> 03:08.430
If your input is repeated in the same pattern of Third the same time you can use this block to express

03:08.430 --> 03:09.050
your input

03:15.600 --> 03:16.530
as the last source.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.310
I want to address in this lecture is called for more space input.

03:21.330 --> 03:25.550
You can import a certain matrix or a value from the workspace.

03:25.560 --> 03:34.650
For example I have defined Victor A equals 2 0 1 2 3 and I'm using display pluck 2 shows a signal.
