And simulating sinks are used to this place and would signal.

00:04.900 --> 00:11.140
So in this lecture I'm going to explain some of the most important sinks blocks that you will use in

00:11.140 --> 00:16.720
your model sinks are found in sinks blocks from the similarly Clay Perry

00:19.450 --> 00:26.470
as you can see I have built a block diagram of a position control system using rate feedback.

00:26.650 --> 00:33.240
The input is an angle star and the output is C the C all in s domain.

00:33.240 --> 00:41.270
The transfer function is of the second order and Katie times S is a rate feedback controller after finishing

00:41.270 --> 00:46.310
is this course you'll be able to build this system and even more complex system so don't worry.

00:46.460 --> 00:52.110
And also intellectual resources you can find the simulating fine of this system.

00:52.230 --> 00:58.890
Now I'm using sine wave as an input for the system ends or are five different sink blocks to express

00:58.890 --> 00:59.930
output signal.

00:59.940 --> 01:09.130
Now let's run this model this is x y graph sync it takes two signals as inputs that are wired in its

01:09.130 --> 01:17.350
pulse connections and plugged the first signal versus the second signal in it to the plot.

01:17.540 --> 01:24.380
I can't change the axis limits by double click and change x minimum X maximum y minimum and Y maximum

01:24.380 --> 01:25.000
values

01:32.270 --> 01:39.530
but you can see in this graph is a relation between the input which is a sine wave and x axis and output

01:39.680 --> 01:40.820
in y axis

01:45.740 --> 01:51.770
scooping scope saying expresses the relation between a given signal which is connected to the scoop

01:51.890 --> 01:52.970
and time

01:56.550 --> 02:01.350
this play block display block is used to express the signal value.

02:01.350 --> 02:07.860
In this example the output signal is displayed each second of the simulation time which is 5 second

02:08.010 --> 02:16.590
until second number 5 is the output of second number 5 is remained on the display block which is minus

02:16.590 --> 02:25.650
0 point 5 8 7 7 if you want to save a good signal to work space or even a file you can use these two

02:25.650 --> 02:32.970
blocks to work space and to file that's open for example to workspace block the variable name is the

02:32.970 --> 02:40.060
name of the variables that is contains the output signal values let's change it for example to a and

02:40.080 --> 02:44.800
runs a model.

02:44.950 --> 02:55.000
Now let's type A this variable contains all of the informations of the Albert signal as you can see

02:55.010 --> 02:59.200
these two columns have pulled the time and output values.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.310
If you want to display the time values type A the time and enter

03:07.930 --> 03:16.640
and for the output signal type a dot data if you want to display for example the fifth value of the

03:16.640 --> 03:24.350
output signal type a data of 5 which is the fifth row common one which is the first goal

03:28.970 --> 03:35.420
to find block in order to save the output signal values in math file in the current path or is a path

03:35.570 --> 03:37.040
that is used in Matlab.

03:37.040 --> 03:41.280
Use this block as you can see this is the name of the math file.

03:41.410 --> 03:48.260
Go the format and in my case it is saved in the desktop variable name is a variable that is used in

03:48.260 --> 03:54.980
the work space to call the Save the value.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.390
Now let's run the model

03:59.380 --> 04:05.100
as you can see in the current past which is a desktop is the one that's math file is saved

04:07.930 --> 04:12.580
and is or space B variable which contains our good signal versus time.
