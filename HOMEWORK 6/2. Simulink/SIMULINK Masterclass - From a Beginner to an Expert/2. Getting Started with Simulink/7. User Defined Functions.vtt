Samuel ink functions sometimes you cannot find the exact functions that you want.

00:05.070 --> 00:12.900
Then you can try the different function blocks the function blocks are found in user defined functions

00:12.950 --> 00:13.670
library.

00:13.950 --> 00:20.460
Let's try the function block I will add display and constant blocks

00:24.440 --> 00:25.410
I will do the wiring

00:29.810 --> 00:35.480
by double clicking the function block we can change the definition of the function which is function

00:35.510 --> 00:36.580
of you.

00:36.740 --> 00:42.080
In this example I will keep it as simple as possible but you can try complex ones.

00:42.530 --> 00:50.480
I will write exponential or e XP of you which will take the signal you and get exponential of it.

00:50.720 --> 01:00.920
OK runs a model as you can see as the result is two point 7 1 8 which is e to the power one.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.710
Let's try 0 for example

01:05.820 --> 01:14.340
so output is 1 in some cases you may want to define a metal a function for example a program function

01:14.340 --> 01:20.280
to do a certain operation or to produce a certain output based on the input to do so.

01:20.280 --> 01:30.850
We use matlab function plot drag and drop the matlab function plug and also a display block and a constant

01:30.850 --> 01:39.000
block now makes a wiring to define the function double click on the plug as you can see is the first

01:39.000 --> 01:44.580
line is function Y equals to FC n or function of you.

01:44.670 --> 01:47.970
So the input is you and output signal is Y.

01:48.090 --> 01:58.810
So I can see for example if you is bigger than or equals to 1 y equals 2 3 semicolon else Y equals 2

01:58.840 --> 02:00.200
negative 3 and

02:04.720 --> 02:08.050
so let's try the input signal 1.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.990
Can you think of the ALP correct.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.720
It's now try 0

02:19.110 --> 02:20.410
correct.

02:20.520 --> 02:27.150
The outlook is negative 3 so functions are very important plucks and Samuel link and for more complex

02:27.150 --> 02:32.100
models in application like automotive or something you will use this pluck a lot.
