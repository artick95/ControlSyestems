The first lecture in dissection is an introduction to Samuel link and how to get his start to lose it.

00:07.030 --> 00:13.820
But before that you need to know what it's simulating simulating is a graphical programming environment

00:13.820 --> 00:18.480
for modeling simulation and analyzing dynamical systems.

00:18.500 --> 00:26.360
It was developed by math works company and it comes as a part of the MATLAB software Simeon link is

00:26.480 --> 00:34.190
plucks environment which means it uses blocks connected to each other to perform certain functions

00:37.000 --> 00:39.790
in order to open some link from matlab.

00:39.970 --> 00:50.260
Select Samuel link library or in the command window you can type Samuel link then enter the symbol link

00:50.260 --> 00:52.630
has two windows the first window.

00:52.810 --> 01:00.340
It's a similar link library browser which contains several libraries each library contains blocks the

01:00.340 --> 01:05.370
second window is the workspace window in which the symbol link Maldon is constructed.

01:07.190 --> 01:13.830
The Samuel link libraries window contains different libraries in different areas in science and engineering.

01:13.880 --> 01:21.680
For example for electrical engineering applications or library is like communications system tool box.

01:21.710 --> 01:27.230
There are other libraries like aerospace neural network and so on.

01:27.670 --> 01:34.340
There's also a similar link library which contains some libraries like commonly used libraries sinks

01:34.550 --> 01:37.100
sources and so on.

01:37.100 --> 01:40.190
Each library contains the different blocks.

01:40.190 --> 01:43.100
Again each block has a certain function.

01:43.250 --> 01:48.470
The similar link model is built by insert things of the from blocks and a model window.

01:48.470 --> 01:54.050
The blocks are connected to each other and forms what we call a process model.

01:56.670 --> 02:02.660
Now let's create our first model and the simple link we will build assemble a model of sine wave and

02:02.670 --> 02:09.700
after building this model you will learn about some blocks like sine wave scoop gain mosque.

02:09.750 --> 02:14.940
You will learn how to insert models into similar link model how to connect the different models and

02:14.940 --> 02:17.690
how to simulate and see as a result.

02:17.880 --> 02:24.300
The purpose of this model is to display that graph of a sine wave and compare it was another one with

02:24.300 --> 02:26.610
a gain of three.

02:26.610 --> 02:34.320
Now let's insert the sine wave block the sine wave block can be found in the sources library the sources

02:34.320 --> 02:42.010
library contains a different signals which can be inputs for different systems.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.830
Now let's drag and drop the sine wave block

02:53.640 --> 02:59.730
if I double click the sine wave block a window which contains a block parameters will appear in this

02:59.730 --> 03:06.360
line as you can see the sine wave equation was the different parameters as written o of T equals two

03:06.360 --> 03:17.360
amplitude times sine of frequency times time plus phase plus pass and frequency here is in red.

03:17.370 --> 03:22.220
Second if you scroll down you can assign some values to the parameters.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.900
In this example I will leave that the hold values

03:32.660 --> 03:36.960
now in order to display the simulated signal from the sine wave.

03:36.980 --> 03:44.570
We need to sing some different types of sinks and we will look at them later on but for now I will drag

03:44.570 --> 03:53.790
and drop the scoop sink the scoop sink is used to display the signal as a graph.

03:53.840 --> 04:02.640
Now I will drag the arrow of the sine wave and connect it to the scoop the model is ready to be simulated

04:02.930 --> 04:05.970
to run the model select run.

04:06.270 --> 04:13.380
It takes sometimes for processing and the result will be ready in order to displays a graph double click

04:13.590 --> 04:14.550
the scoop block.
