00:00.180 --> 00:06.210
In this video I want to show you three important blocks that are used in signal rooting and symbol link

00:06.270 --> 00:09.960
marks the max embossed from signal rooting library.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.690
I will add Max and Max blocks

00:20.170 --> 00:21.240
I will add sine wave.

00:21.240 --> 00:21.550
BLOCK

00:27.050 --> 00:27.810
game plop.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.230
And scoop block

00:43.300 --> 00:48.940
the max block is used to combine its inputs to a single Victor.

00:48.960 --> 00:55.770
Output was one important condition that there must be the same type as output which is now more than

00:55.770 --> 00:57.970
one signal can be plotted for example.

00:58.110 --> 01:02.860
Let's see as a simple example of sine wave which we have built before.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.860
Whereas a sine wave to again signal change the gain signal to 5.

01:07.860 --> 01:14.340
So that to increase the amplitude of the sine wave by five when multiplied together and the output is

01:14.430 --> 01:19.940
the first input to Max plot drag another signal from the sine wave simply by right click and drag.

01:19.950 --> 01:29.610
This is a second input was the max block whereas amongst 2 a scoop only is a sine wave amplitude to

01:29.610 --> 01:31.100
1 now runs a model

01:33.900 --> 01:39.780
as you can see post the sine wave signal and 5 sine wave signal are plotted in one graph.

01:42.380 --> 01:50.200
If you want again to separate these signals we use the max block I will copy for example two scoops

01:53.290 --> 01:57.100
and takes the signal of the max from this model wire them

02:00.990 --> 02:03.860
now run.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.040
This is a 5 sine

02:07.950 --> 02:09.360
and this is the sine

02:12.690 --> 02:20.440
number of output of the max can be change it from here similarly number of inputs of Max can be changed

02:20.470 --> 02:25.510
from here.

02:25.530 --> 02:32.970
Now let's see the bus in some cases your system may have many signals and you want a way to keep everything

02:32.970 --> 02:38.190
tidy and not having birds of Nest or wires running everywhere.

02:38.190 --> 02:42.660
We use bus blocks bus can contain signals from different types

02:46.030 --> 02:54.980
so at bus we add two blocks bus creator and bus selectors I will add another constant block

03:06.000 --> 03:09.660
double click on the bus creator and select the number of inputs to be sweet

03:14.620 --> 03:16.280
now where's a a of some pluck.

03:17.460 --> 03:18.420
Let's make it three

03:21.540 --> 03:22.680
the sine wave signal

03:25.290 --> 03:28.000
and the five sine wave signal.

03:28.020 --> 03:32.930
Now I have created a bus that contains three different signals.

03:32.970 --> 03:38.640
I cannot wires a bus plug directly to a scoop because remember it may contain signals from different

03:38.640 --> 03:39.000
type.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.810
So this is the importance of both selector.

03:42.030 --> 03:47.280
It's a block that connected to bus creator and it will contain the different signals as you can see

03:52.140 --> 03:53.780
if I wired this to scoop.

03:53.790 --> 03:59.520
As you can see it shows that this is signal number one so that you can have a better look on the signal

03:59.520 --> 04:02.060
you want and this is signal number two.

04:02.070 --> 04:05.780
Now double click the bus selector on the left.

04:05.810 --> 04:09.200
All the signals come from the bus creator are shown on the right.

04:09.200 --> 04:16.910
The signals that are selected I can add in a signal for example signal number one just click here and

04:16.970 --> 04:19.960
click on signal number one and click.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.230
Select that signal three and I will remove the signal

04:28.270 --> 04:29.400
I will add another scoop

04:34.350 --> 04:35.730
now run.

04:35.730 --> 04:36.930
This is a five sine

04:39.750 --> 04:49.770
This is a constant three and this is the sine signal in the next three to you we will look at selectors

04:49.830 --> 04:51.990
and switches so see you there.
