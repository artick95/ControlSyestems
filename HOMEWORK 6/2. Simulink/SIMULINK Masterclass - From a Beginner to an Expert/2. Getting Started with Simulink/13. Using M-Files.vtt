Along with your students and welcome to this new lecture in which I will teach you how to use m files

00:06.090 --> 00:07.790
into your simulation model.

00:07.830 --> 00:16.140
So here I have this model which is step block here multiplied to gain 0 five and the results is plotted

00:16.230 --> 00:17.360
using this scoop.

00:17.820 --> 00:28.130
So if I run this model for three seconds I have this plot of a scoop of step with five.

00:28.280 --> 00:35.450
In some cases it's better to define the value of your gains or different variables of your system in

00:35.490 --> 00:42.800
workspace or using and files so that when you need to change these variables you don't change them in

00:42.800 --> 00:46.290
your Samuel link model because this work will be exhausting.

00:46.350 --> 00:53.330
Steve you change these values in your end file or in your command window so I will show you now how

00:53.330 --> 00:59.030
to use variables from your command window or m files into your Samuel link model.

00:59.510 --> 01:01.730
So first I will go to the command window.

01:03.380 --> 01:05.860
I'll type CLEC to clear.

01:05.990 --> 01:11.410
Now I will define a variable of a equals 2 for example 5.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.980
Now as a workspace has a the value is 5.

01:16.850 --> 01:19.660
I will go back to my Samuel link model.

01:19.660 --> 01:27.470
I will double click the again and I will change the gain value to a game is not a number now it's a

01:27.470 --> 01:35.210
variable a I will click OK and wrong my model other than get any error message.

01:35.210 --> 01:44.640
So my model is okay I will double click this model the step is five if I want for example to change

01:44.640 --> 01:56.320
the value of a CLEC A equals to three And back to my model again and run the model.

01:56.990 --> 01:59.200
You'll see that the gain is SRI

02:02.580 --> 02:06.170
in most cases we don't use workspace to Define variables.

02:06.190 --> 02:09.930
Instead we use m file to define our variables.

02:09.930 --> 02:19.580
So I have defined new in file I will call it Samuel link and file define for example variable X equals

02:19.580 --> 02:28.510
to five variable Y equals two three and z equals 2 6.

02:28.850 --> 02:30.640
I will save this file.

02:31.280 --> 02:42.720
X y z save and I will run this file factories or in space I will find that X equals to 5 y equals 2

02:42.720 --> 02:46.350
3 and z equals to 6.

02:46.350 --> 02:53.420
Now I will pack to my model the symbol link I will change the variable to X No.

02:53.440 --> 02:59.560
K runs a model the scope shows a step of 5.

03:00.490 --> 03:04.750
I can for example type X times Y.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.600
Okay now run

03:11.210 --> 03:15.050
its value of three times five which is 15.

03:15.260 --> 03:21.780
So I can do operations inside the step definition.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.780
I can say X times Y over Z now.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.120
K and run the model.

03:33.410 --> 03:38.230
And I have this value of 2.5 which is 15.

03:38.240 --> 03:46.410
Over 6 it's more easier to use m files in your model instead of defining your different variables as

03:46.410 --> 03:48.920
values inside your Samuel link model.

03:48.930 --> 03:55.080
As I have stated before it's very exhausting to change the different values of these variables.

03:55.080 --> 04:02.190
If you want to change as a model parameters so Steed go to your m file and change different variables.

04:02.190 --> 04:03.480
That's all for this value.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.010
Thank you guys for watching and see you in the next week.

04:06.020 --> 04:06.250
You.
