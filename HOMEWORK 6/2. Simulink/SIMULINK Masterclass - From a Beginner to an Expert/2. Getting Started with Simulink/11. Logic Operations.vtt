Logical operations similarly can be used for logical operations like comparison signals or even carrying

00:08.520 --> 00:11.390
and or exhaust and so on.

00:11.490 --> 00:17.030
The output of these logic operations is boolean Type 1 if through 0.

00:17.040 --> 00:24.690
If false is a different logic operation plucks are found in logic in that operation library.

00:24.690 --> 00:32.250
Let's talk about street the from blocks compared to Coniston compared to 0 and relational operator compared

00:32.250 --> 00:32.830
to Coniston.

00:32.850 --> 00:40.280
Pluck is used to compare an input signal u to a constant which is added in constant value.

00:40.290 --> 00:45.670
You can also choose a comparison or as operator or even you can change the output data type.

00:45.690 --> 00:51.480
In this example one is being compared to three operator is less than or equal so as the output signal

00:51.480 --> 01:00.360
is true or one compared to zero block in this block the signal is compared to 0 and it gains operator

01:00.360 --> 01:09.530
can be selected from the block options since 1 is not less than or equal to zero as the answer is Fool's

01:09.620 --> 01:18.210
or 0 relational operator is used to compare two signals a gains operator can be selected from here

01:22.890 --> 01:30.110
we can also add logical operator which can be defined to be and NAND or or whatever

01:32.900 --> 01:34.350
I will drag this guy here.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.090
I will copy display pluck

01:43.280 --> 01:47.320
double clicks a block you can select a different operator from here.

01:56.690 --> 02:01.560
For example three and one the output is 1.

02:01.640 --> 02:05.170
You can also customize the shape of the block from here.

02:05.270 --> 02:10.730
I have a dash to be the file which contains a true stable of different logical operator if you want

02:10.730 --> 02:11.750
to refresh your memory.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.350
Thank you guys for watching.

02:13.370 --> 02:15.980
In the next video I will talk about subsystems.
