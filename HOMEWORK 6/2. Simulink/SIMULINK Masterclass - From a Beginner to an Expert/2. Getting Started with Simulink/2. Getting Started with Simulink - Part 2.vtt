00:01.800 --> 00:05.140
In the previous view we've built a sine wave model.

00:05.430 --> 00:11.560
The model produces a signal through sine wave source block and the signal is shown on a graph.

00:11.700 --> 00:14.180
By using the scoop sync.

00:14.190 --> 00:20.400
Now let's add a gain to the signal a gain is a constant numbers that is multiplied to the output of

00:20.400 --> 00:21.170
the signal.

00:21.210 --> 00:27.740
In this model we will amplify the sine wave signal pi three in order to add the gain block.

00:27.750 --> 00:30.000
I will open the library's window

00:33.510 --> 00:37.380
from commonly used window drag and drop the game block

00:40.870 --> 00:48.880
I will delete this connection by simply selecting at them press delete let's drag this here and DOS

00:48.880 --> 00:50.040
and new connections

00:57.980 --> 01:05.600
the default value for the gain is 1 in order to change the gain value double click the game plunk block

01:05.630 --> 01:13.210
parameters window will appear change the gain from 1 2 for example 3.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.350
Now let's run the model

01:18.310 --> 01:24.580
as you can see is a sine wave is amplified by a gain of 3 and the amplitude of the signal is Sri

01:29.060 --> 01:32.300
that's for example changes again to 5

01:37.740 --> 01:40.410
the amplitude has a change to 5

01:43.800 --> 01:50.520
if you want for example to show the two graphs of the sine wave signal before and after is a gain at

01:50.520 --> 01:57.960
the same time we will use a block called mosque or Multiplex or this block can be found in the commonly

01:57.960 --> 02:05.220
used blocks the purpose of this block is to take more than one signal and combine them into one single

02:05.220 --> 02:11.760
vector then the output of the mosque block will be the input to the school block in newer versions of

02:11.760 --> 02:18.570
similar lings the scoop block can be modified to take more than one input anyways I'm using MATLAB 2013

02:18.660 --> 02:20.850
which I think doesn't have this option

02:25.850 --> 02:27.810
I will drag and drop the mosque block

02:35.240 --> 02:36.950
I will remove all connections

02:39.990 --> 02:45.740
the first input to the mosque is the input of the game block the second input is a sine wave signal

02:45.990 --> 02:54.090
so I will right click the output of the sine wave and drag it to the mosque block to create a duplicate

02:54.120 --> 02:55.650
to the sine wave signal.

02:56.070 --> 03:03.140
Finally is Albert of the mosque block is displayed in the school block now runs a model

03:06.260 --> 03:12.620
as you can see we have the two graphs of the two signals the old one was amplitude equals to one and

03:12.620 --> 03:15.680
the new one was amplitude equals to five.
